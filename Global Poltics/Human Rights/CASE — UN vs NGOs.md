**UN**
- veto abuses is prominent
	- threaten UN legitimacy
	- immense smart power to the permeant 5
	- 
- especially in face of humanitarian issues
	- 27/30 of the past veto have blocked resolutions to humanitarian issues (oxfam's 2025 report)
- due to a structural contradiction
	- general assembly's majority have no binding power while the P5 have binding power

**NGOs**
- NGOs have taken humanitarian responsibilities
	- first to respond in Gaza, Syria, Ukraine
- however NGOs have fractured funding systems and no enforcement capabilites
	- limit its legitimacy

**Path forwards**
- limiting veto powers of P5
- formalize NGOs
