# Levels of Analysis

[Thomas Paine] and [Immanuel Kant]
## Individual Level 
*Summary: People are inherently peaceful. People are not inherently peaceful but good institution will reduce conflicts.*
### Revolutionary Liberalism
Paine believes in the intrinsic goodness of people which are only obscured by non-democracies and quotes with extreme optimism of people’s harmony,
> “man is the natural friend of other man.”
### Evolutionary Liberalism
Kant believes that people have intrinsic goodness and evil and that institutional conditioning compel people towards harmony. 
## State Level
*Summary: Democracy reduce conflict because people are inherently doesn't like war. Increase in institutions decrease military means less threat to others and allows everyone to be more peaceful.*

Paine and Kant both argues that [[democracy]] are inherently peaceful and as when the citizens are presented with the option of peace and war, people will favour peace. Paine and Kant give the example of “butter or gun” dilemma and argues in favour of butter.

Paine and Kant argues that increasing military spending will inevitably decrease quality of life and vice versa, and in a [[democracy]], people will prefer their individual quality of life over war. 

Further more Paine and Kant argues the [[Spiral Model]]: when one state increases military spending for the purpose of security, it is seen as a threat to another state, which compel the other state to increases arms too, leading to a spiral of suspicion.

Paine argues that to resolve this issue and promote long term peace and prosperity, all state should unarm, and keep only [[non-proactive defence]].

Kant however argues that in an anarchy world, states are sometimes forced to build arms in face of authoritarian states and sometimes preventative attacks are necessary to states with military build up.

## System Level
*Summary: Economic interdependence reduces conflict and promote peace.*

Paine argues that [[Interdependence]] and free trade will foster understanding between states and it lead to peace and prosperity as it "cordialize" people.

Kant argues similar ideas that free trade lead to peace but not based on understanding,  cooperation, and morality but instead on that financial powers. Kant suggests that the financial incentives of free trade can not co-exist with conflict and that financial powers — interests of businesses — will stop high-level conflict threatening commerce. 

Paine also argues that the political liberty, peace, and prosper depends on the liberty of neighbouring states, and there should be offensive interference in other states that lacks justice.

Kant however argues that although neighbouring states’ liberty are crucial, their [[Sovereignty]] and independent rights should not be interfered. 

Evolutionary Liberalist believes that real liberalism occur natually within a state throught the natural formation of democracy and institutions. All external interference leads to premature forms which ends up in anarchy.

Revolutionary Liberalist such as Paine see no reason in patience, people are naturally good, and destruction of non-democracies are justified.
# Liberal Triangle of Peace
All three types are summarized above in the levels of analysis
## Interdependence Liberalism
- Note: Focus on mutual reliance.
- Democracy is more likely to engage in economic interdependence can foster peace and stability
- Realists views independence of the Cold War era as the key to the long lasting peace.
- First revolutionary Liberalism of Paine suggests that economic interdependence will foster understanding and cooperation as it cordialize people.
- Second, evolutionary Liberalism of Kant suggests that financial gains and conflict can not co-exist thus the interest of business will mediate all high-level conflict that will harm commerce.
	- Leaders will contemplate about the cost of escalating conflicts when there is large interdependent markets at risk. 
	- However some scholars suggest that there are conditions:
		- There is a difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical relations between states. Only in symmetrical states can interdependence flourish and conflicts reduced. In an asymmetrical interdependence, it invites the more powerful state to exploit and oppress the weaker.
		- Only when states have mutual belief that trade will continue to grow and no unavoidable factor will limit trade will interdependence continue.
		- Interdependence would only limit conflict where the interdependence involves trade of crucial or strategic goods. 
	- However contradictions exist 
		- Statistical analysis doesn't always align
		- Some analysis suggests that market openness reduce conflicts not interdependence
		- Other suggests that an reciprocal relation is at play, low conflict leads to interdependence.
		- Lastly the 1914 July Crisis and the Rhineland Crisis showed no consideration from leaders of costs
## Republican Liberalism
* Democracy will assure peace
* Revolutionary Liberalism of Paine and Evolutionary Liberalism of Kant both suggest that democracy will promote peace as non-conditioned  people are inclined towards comfort of institution than war. They present the classical [butter-or-gun dilemma] and both suggest butter. 
* Over the years empirical studies were performed and revealed that democracies did not reduce the frequencies of conflicts. 
* However [[Michael Doyle]] performed a study that included that target and source of inter-state conflict and revealed that although democracies engage as eagerly in conflict as autocracies, no two democracies engaged in full-scale war ever, revealing a new form of peace 
	* Doyle’s studies initiated an avalanche of empirical studies toward the question “why does democracies act differently” 
	- This is called the: [[Democratic Peace Theory|Democratic peace theory]]
- Two solutions are presented that explains the democratic peace theory
	- First (the [dyadic democratic peace]) is that democracies naturally understand the nature of each other and understand each side faces democratic constraints on use of force, which dampens escalations and stops the cycle of suspicion.
	- Second (the [monadic democratic peace]) suggests that instead of relying on the belief of the peacefulness of the other party that leads to deescalation, it is the institutional constraints that is placed upon democratic leaders which makes democracies less likely for to initiate conflict no matter the opposition.
## Liberal Institutionalism 
- Note: focus on cooperation 
- International institutions can help facilitate cooperation and reduce conflict as they possesses structural power to shape [global governance]
- Realist argues that international institutions are ineffective and are controlled by powerful states
- Classical liberal institutions focused mainly on [formal international organizations] (ie. UN) however neoliberal institutionalism shifted focus towards a broader [international organization] and the broadest sense of [global goverence]
	- For example the banking sectors's response of the debt crisis of the 1980s in multiple Latin American states showed a informal regime of cooperation between banks.
- International institutions promote peace in a few ways.
	- First they mediate conflict (ie. [good offices of the UN Secretary General]) and adjudicate disputes (Ie. [International Court of Justice])
	- Second they promote international norms, monitor compliance, and punish violators. 
	- Third they can alter cost-benefit calculations by decreasing costs of conformability and increase cost of military build up.
	- Several international institutions possesses multiple mechanics at once. For example the World Trade Organizations (WTO) and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) promote international norms, monitor compliances, and alter cost-benefit calculations (by promoting interdependence liberalism in the case of the WTO, by banning the use of chemical weapons and collectively punishing violators in the case of OPCW)
