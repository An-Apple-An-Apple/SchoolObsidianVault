The sustained increase of the standard of living of a society.

From a [[capitalist]] perspective, [[Development|development]] is mostly a increase of capital.
From other perspectives [[Development|development]], could focus on healthcare, education.
But from the most general perspective, development seeks to increase the average standard of living of a society.

[[Global Poltics/Key Concepts/Power]], often the control of resources, is highly linked with development. More developed countries have access to more resources, and more resources allows a country to develop more.

Development through globalization, international cooperation through IGO and other regional organizations, is critiqued to infringe on the [[Sovereignty|Sovereignty]] of nation state. [[Interdependence]] in a multilateral framework through agreements and treaties diminish the ability for countries to control themselves.

[[Development]] also linked with peace and conflict. Lesser the [[Development|development]], greater the violence. 

Through the increasing [[Interdependence]], this [[globalization]] means the [[Development|development]] in one part of the word inevitably have repercussion in other parts of the world. Benefits of this includes the pooled sovereignty of collective efforts to act on global issues like climate change and terrorism. However it also means that the market with higher cost of living may be lost as production shifts to underdevelopment countries. 

[[inequality]] of [[Development|development]] is also often discussed. [[Development]] in some conditions are critiqued to have increased the disparity between the richest and the poorest.
