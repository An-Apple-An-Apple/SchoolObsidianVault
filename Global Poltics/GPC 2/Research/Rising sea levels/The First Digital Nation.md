# Summary
Tuvalu is going to be submerged by water (Lack Source).
Tuvalu is digitizing.
Under current law, sovereignty requires permanent population and protected territory, neither of which Tuvalu is going to have.
Tuvalu is calling upon a legal change (structural power) to legitimize themselves under sea level rises.
The denial of mainland states to recognize the non-territorial based sovereignty of island nations can be seen as an act of structural violence that disproportionally impact small island developing states.
