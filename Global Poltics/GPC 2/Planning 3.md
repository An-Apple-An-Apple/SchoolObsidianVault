**Inquiry Question**: How does complex interdependence impact the sovereignty of Pacific Island States in face of rising sea levels?

**Thesis**: In face of rising sea levels, the complex environmental, economical, and political interdependence allows Great Powers erodes to erode the sovereignty of Pacific Island States.

**Topic Area**: Environment, (Borders, Equality)

**Introduction:** Most PIS's elevation is below 2m from the sea level. With climate change causing inevitable sea level rises over the next centuries, PIS faces the utmost dangers as extreme weather conditions continue to erode their livelihood. Potential submersion are also expected to occur over the next centuries with 2℃ temperature rises completely submerging Tuvalu, Kiribati, Maldives, and the Marshall Islands.

**Argument 1:** Environmental interdependence. Climate changes and subsequent sea level rises have strong repercussions on Pacific Island States. It erodes habitable land and forces emigration, thus challenging the de facto sovereignty of Pacific Islands States.
- Classical realist sovereignty envision a table of billiard balls interacting with each other. The hard shell of sovereignty separates the internal functions of a state from the external influence of others.
- External sovereignty is thus the ability of a state to be completely autonomous within a society of global actors with its territory and political independence inviolable. Internal sovereignty then is the supreme authority within a state and can be argued to be a monopoly of hard power.
- Within a state system, however, the legal recognition of a state sovereignty and actual control are two distinct concepts.
- While rising sea levels, by all legal means, maintains the position of state as the supreme authority of power, it undermines its ability to actually rule.
- Long before PIS are completely submerged, their lands are uninhabitable. At this point states can no longer provide the basic necessities to support life.
- Rising sea levels erodes infrastructure, causes soil salinization thus threatening arable land, drowns population. These effects ultimately forces PIS to loss the power to protect their citizens.
- On the global stage while PIS may maintain the ability to to conduct international affairs, keeping their external sovereignty, they loss all means of controlling what goes on inside.
- Although by law, you physically own now shrunken but still existent the land, (fishing, constructing, legal control), states can no longer physically control that land. PIS keep their legal internal sovereignty to be the sole authority within their state, reflected in their monopoly to pass law and collect tax, but they lose the physical capacity to enact that. 
- Even though the Pacific Island States are not the main producers of CO_2, the complex interdependence of the global climate forces repercussion on on them.

**Argument 2**: Economic asymmetry. Adaptation plans of the Pacific Island States to ameliorate impact of rising sea levels is significantly greater than their economic capacity. Conditional loans from IGOs is the only viable solution which limits the external sovereignty of Pacific Island States.
- De facto external sovereignty is the ability for states to act autonomously on the world stage.
- Raising sea levels require massive sums of money for adaptation plans. Marshall Islands, for example, estimates 5B/35B for a 0.5/2.0m sea level rise; 18/125x their annual GPD of 0.28B.
- To pay for such situations, PIS are forced to seek external loans for IGOs like IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, etc.
- Policy autonomy is the idea that states have complete, autonomous control of their policies on everything that goes on within their territories. Conditionality of such loans also requires structural reform programs, such as privatizing industries, cutting public spending, tax reform, and increase natural resource extraction and export. Loans of this kind strips PIS of self governance with appointed consultants taking over national budget to ensure debt is paid. This surrenders the political autonomy of PIS to the hands of IGOs 
- Although these are internationally recognized to have sovereignty, their economic sovereignty is ultimately lost. Economic sovereignty is based on the idea that states have strong national economy and have strong regulatory power on what goes in and what goes out. By surrendering policy autonomy to external IGO, they also surrender economic sovereignty by integrating themselves into the global economic system in order to repay loans
- Relating to dependency theory, dependent countries will be kept dependent on core countries.
**Argument 3**: Global Governance. Instability of territory caused by rising sea level renders sovereignty of Pacific Island States dependent on global governance, which erodes sovereignty.
- The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States includes the international standard on the definition of a state. Article 1 indicates that states must have an defined territory, permanent population, effective government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. 
- Two schools of thoughts underline what is a state. The Declaratory frameworks follows a realist approach and indicates that an entity becomes a state when it meets the conditions of a state, and the legitimate recognition of others are indecisive. The Constitutive framework however critical approach highlighting that states are states when it is recognized by others as states and that its statehood is constructed by its legitimacy.
- Land loss caused by rising sea levels removes PIS' status as functional states recognized by the Montevideo Convention — as they can, in the future, no longer have defined territory, and forced emigration nullify the permanent population. By the declarative framework, the statehood of PIS are diminishing and it external sovereignty and legitimacy along with it. 
- In order to maintain statehood, multiple costal nation-states, primarily PIS, have worked to change international law to recognize non-territorial sovereignty, a protection of states in the face of physical erosion of borders.
- As PIS' physical territory disappear on the map, their sovereignty relies completely on the recognition of other states. Thus they become dependent on international law recognizing them and on global governance on enforcing this recognition. They now reply completely on the constitutive framework
- While some states already assumed the presumptions of change, the idea that the conditions that formed a states does not need to exist for the continuation of a state (for example borders, territory, and population, ie. European states exiled in London during WWII), others don't. Without physical presence backing up the the PIS, their sovereignty, legitimacy, and power are limited and dependent on the acceptance of others.
- PIS, in face of rising climates, need the UN to continue their recognition of their previous borders and IGOs to fund their survival. If PIS have no land, they live in the mind of the leaders of great powers that can shape structural framework (a single veto and vote them in or out), thus they have to align their identity and values to the interest of other states, ultimately losing their political autonomy.

**Recommendation**
PIS have two options, give up and borrow money. Tuvalu's digital nation project is the example of the first — non-territorial state. By buying land throughout other states and emmigrating its population out, it represents a passives approach towards eroding sea levels. However this requires the recognition of other states, especially great powers, of non-territorial states, which would set precedent of claiming ocean territory. This align with the interest of great powers and may prove successful. However this ultimately loses the internal and external sovereignty of states.

Another option that PIS have is adaptation, exemplified by Marshall Island's adaptation plan. However this inevitably leads to loans and debt traps. One path down this debt trap could be a vicious cycle of greater dependence like with example of Ghana where 14x more money is paid towards debt than public spending, which creates weaker economy. However a counterargument is with the example of South Korea — one of the poorest country after WWII, trapped with IMF structural adjustment program and debt traps, however is now one of the biggest economy in the world.
