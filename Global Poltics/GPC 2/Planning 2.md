**How does rising sea level challenge Westphalian Sovereignty?**

Raising sea levels threatens Westphalian Sovereignty by decoupling from a fundamental condition — stable and defensible territory.  
[topic and position]
[phrase that a bit better with a umbrella]
[too broad, maybe just use pacific islands]

### Pacific States Disappearing
- Pacific Island State
- Some to completely disappear
- Loss of territory but preservation of sovereignty?
	- precedent for other states to claim water sovereignty? 
- structural power -> campaign
	- Tuvalu's "digital nation" project; Kiribati's "Migration with Dignity" policy
- [access to the sea changes, affect on population, part of definiton of soveriegnty is population]
### Economic imbalance 
- costal states' defence of territorial sovereignty depends on weatlh
- Contrast the Maldives (building artificial island fortresses) with Bangladesh (planning for the managed retreat of millions). 
- Contrast the Netherlands' Delta Works with the inundation of informal settlements in Lagos or Jakarta.
- third generational vs first generational rights: defend the borders or defend the people
- leads to inequality via an erosion of exclusive sovereignty
- economic power -> economic power that created climate changes now dictates who can get out
	- structural power -> economic powers changed the environmental structure that threatens the sovereignty of the states with the least economic powers
- Dependency theories
- [fishing rights, ]
### Legal Disputes
- even without existential threats, costal states risk shrinking [EEZ](https://en.mercopress.com/2021/03/11/pacific-small-islands-fear-rising-seas-will-distort-their-claims-to-eezs)
- if states can not sustain human settlements, by UNCLOS, its a rock, thus no EEZ
- combined EEZ loss of pacific states is over 40M KM Squared, larger than [africa](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/islands-rocks-and-tuna-pacific-nations-draw-new-battle-lines-against-rising-se-idUSKBN2B3053/)
- Loss of EEZ would allow foriegn industries to replace local ones, 
- some states fixes territorial borders contridicting the UNCLOS's amblatory sea line
- shrinking states may be able to maintain de jure sovereignty but loses ultimately de factor sovereignty
	- claim without control
- this challenges the westphilian sovereignty of defendable landmass.
