> Although DNA has large storage capacity, it still have a finite number of possible arrangements. 

> [!INFO] EXPLAIN command term
> 1. List individual points.

> [!TIP] Hydrogen Bonds
> Hydrogen bonds do not form between complementary bases of RNA because its single stranded. Ignore exceptions of when it is double stranded by itself or with a DNA strand.

> [!TIP] Label
> Label all diagrams as much as possible.

> [!TIP] DNA is always two strand
> Always draw and say DNA is two strand and RNA is one.
