"Chair, this committee must confront an uncomfortable truth: some states do not merely tolerate cybercrime—they sponsor it, profit from it, and weaponize it.

The Netherlands proposes a simple test. If a nation allowed criminal gangs to operate training camps on its territory, launched physical attacks against other nations' citizens and infrastructure, and then claimed 'we cannot control non-state actors'—would this committee accept that explanation? Of course not. This body would recognize it as state complicity.

Yet when Russian-speaking ransomware groups generate 69% of global ransomware proceeds—over $500 million annually [Gov](https://business.gov.nl/amendment/better-protection-crypto-assets/)—and operate openly from Russian territory without prosecution, this committee is asked to treat this as a capacity problem rather than a policy choice.

When Russia legalizes cryptocurrency explicitly to evade sanctions [Coinfomania](https://coinfomania.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-in-the-netherlands/) and state-owned banks facilitate crypto transactions for sanctions evasion [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netherlands), this is not inadvertent—it is intentional state policy.

The Netherlands asks delegates to consider the victims. A hospital's computer systems encrypted by ransomware—patients cannot receive care. A business extorted for millions—workers lose jobs. An elderly person scammed of life savings—they face poverty. These are not abstract cyber incidents. They are **assaults with real victims and real harm**.

The physical location of the attack is irrelevant to the victim. Whether a criminal breaks into one's home physically or digitally, whether they steal with a weapon or with malware—the violation is the same. The harm is real.

Three major Russian exchanges remain under U.S. sanctions for processing over $100 million in cybercrime proceeds [Coinpedia](https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-the-netherlands-2024/)—yet they continue operating with impunity. Russian darknet markets processed $1.4 billion in 2023—five times all Western markets combined [Gov](https://business.gov.nl/amendment/better-protection-crypto-assets/).

Chair, if any nation allowed organized criminal cartels to operate training facilities, manufacture weapons, and attack other nations' citizens without prosecution, this committee would not debate that nation's capacity—it would recognize state failure or complicity. The same standard must apply to cyber-enabled crime.

The Russian Federation signed the Hanoi Convention. China signed the Hanoi Convention. Yet their signatures carry no meaning when the world's largest ransomware ecosystem operates from Russian territory [Gov](https://business.gov.nl/amendment/better-protection-crypto-assets/) and when China criminalizes citizens' crypto activities while the state holds $17.6 billion in Bitcoin [UNTC](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?mtdsg_no=XVIII-16&chapter=18&clang=_en).

This committee faces a choice: will it treat state-sponsored or state-tolerated cybercrime as the serious violation of international norms that it is? Or will it allow diplomatic language to obscure criminal complicity?

The Netherlands calls for accountability. States that provide safe harbor to cyber-criminals—whether through deliberate policy or willful negligence—must face consequences comparable to those hosting physical criminal infrastructure. A digital assault is still an assault. A state-tolerated crime is still a crime. And a treaty signature without enforcement is still complicity."

### **North Atlantic Treaty (1949) - Article 5**

**Full Text**: "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."

Russia signed Hanoi while hosting the world's largest cyber-criminal ecosystem. This is not capacity failure—it is policy choice. States providing safe harbor to cyber-criminals must face accountability comparable to those hosting physical criminal infrastructure. A digital assault is still an assault."

"NATO has established that cyber-attacks of sufficient severity can trigger Article 5 collective defense obligations. The threshold is case-by-case, but when Russian-tolerated ransomware groups generate $500 million annually from NATO territory attacks [Gov](https://business.gov.nl/amendment/better-protection-crypto-assets/), when hospitals cannot function, when critical infrastructure faces persistent compromise—NATO members must evaluate whether forbearance remains tenable."
