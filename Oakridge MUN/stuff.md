# Opening Statement
"Honorable Chair, distinguished delegates,

The Kingdom of the Netherlands views cryptocurrency as an important technological development with legitimate economic potential. However, without proper oversight, it becomes a tool for cybercrime, money laundering, and corruption. Our national experience—through MiCA implementation, strict licensing requirements, and enforcement by Dutch financial authorities—shows that regulation can support innovation while reducing criminal activity.

The Netherlands’ approach aligns with the **UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime**, the **UN Convention Against Corruption**, and the **Budapest Convention**, which provide the international basis for cooperation on cybercrime and financial integrity. These frameworks demonstrate that effective regulation strengthens state sovereignty and protects fundamental rights.

The Netherlands encourages this committee to focus on practical, coordinated standards for AML/KYC, information sharing, and tracing illicit crypto flows. We are prepared to contribute technical expertise and support collective efforts to reduce cybercrime while enabling responsible technological progress."
# Positions
**International efforts**
“The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports cryptocurrency as a legitimate digital innovation, but stresses that its misuse for cybercrime threatens state sovereignty and the legitimacy of public institutions. Our position is grounded in the **United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC, 2000)** and the **Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (2001)**, both of which affirm state responsibility to prevent and investigate transnational crime. These treaties already provide a normative and legal basis for international regulation and cooperation in a multi-lateral world system. The Netherlands therefore urges all delegates to ensure standardized oversight for cryptocurrency exchanges, ensuring transparency and oversight while preserving economic innovation.”

**Regulation Efforts**
“To protect the legitimacy of global cryptocurrency markets, the Netherlands supports robust yet innovation-friendly regulation. Services that obscure transactions—such as mixers and privacy coins—are frequently exploited for ransomware payments, money laundering, and other transnational crimes. The **EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA, 2023)** provides a strong model for balancing technological progress with consumer protection and accountability. The Kingdom's position is not to ban such tools outright, but to ensure transparency, traceability, and responsible use. This approach reinforces the rule of law and prevents non-state criminal actors from undermining international security.”

**Multi-lateral Efforts**
“Cybercriminals utilizing cryptocurrency often move funds across borders within minutes, challenging traditional ideas of state power and control. The Netherlands supports expanding cooperation through institutions such as **Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)** and the **Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT)**. We also acknowledge the ongoing work on the **UN Cybercrime Convention (Ad Hoc Committee, 2022–2024)** as an opportunity to formalize faster international coordination. A rapid-response mechanism—capable of freezing illicit crypto assets and sharing information instantly—would strengthen global security and reinforce state sovereignty against decentralized non-state threats.”
# Response
**"Netherlands didn't sign Hanoi—Netherlands oppose international cooperation"**
"The Kingdom of the Netherlands is party to the Budapest Convention, the UN Convention Against Corruption, and implements MiCA and FATF(Financial Action Task's Force) standards. The Kingdom have **more** binding international obligations than most signatories here. The Hanoi Convention represents a global equilivant based on the Budapest Convention for the Council of Europe. Parallel treaties signatories create execution deficiencies in differing interpretations. Cooperation requires trust, and trust requires safeguards. Hanoi's Article 24 makes human rights protections discretionary. The Kingdom will not sign a treaty that weakens existing standards."

**"Crypto-positive stance enables money laundering and terrorism"**
**Netherlands prioritizes profit over security**
"The opposite is true. The Kingdom of the Netherlands fined Bybit €2.25 million for non-compliance [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netherlands). The Kingdom forced Binance out of our market. We license and supervise all 36 legal crypto businesses and restrict all non-compliant ones [Data&Privacyweb](https://privacy-web.nl/en/nieuws/strijd-tegen-cybercrime-krijgt-mondiale-vorm-maar-tegen-welke-prijs/). Transparency defeats crime; opacity enables it. Jurisdictions that ban or ignore crypto create black markets where criminals thrive. Our enforcement record speaks for itself. The delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands respectfully asks where is {countries}'s"

**Western nations impose standards on developing countries—neocolonialism**
"The Netherlands does not impose standards—we implement FATF recommendations developed through consensus of 39 member jurisdictions and implemented in over 200, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey. These are global standards, not Western standards. This is partnership, not neocolonialism.""

**Hanoi vs Budapest**
"The Hanoi Convention backbone is copied from Budapest [UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/cybercrime/convention/home.html)—the difference is Budapest **mandates** human rights safeguards while Hanoi makes them optional. If Hanoi truly provides 'balance,' why did it weaken protections? Budapest's Article 15 requires judicial supervision, proportionality, and limitations [Slashdot](https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/27/157252/more-than-60-un-members-sign-cybercrime-treaty-opposed-by-rights-groups). Hanoi Article 24 does not. That's not balance—that's regression."

**Netherlands is hypocritical—benefit from crypto but criticize others**
"Exactly. The Kingdom of the Netherlands **benefit** from cryptocurrency because we regulate it properly. We issued the EU's first MiCA licenses [Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3035dfb4-585a-4911-873f-79706fa935ef). We require all market since 2024 to be MiCA compliant under AML/CFT frameworks. We prove innovation and security coexist. The hypocrisy lies with delegates who sign cooperation treaties while legalizing crypto to evade sanctions [Coinfomania](https://coinfomania.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-in-the-netherlands/) or hosting cybercrime ecosystems [Gov](https://business.gov.nl/amendment/better-protection-crypto-assets/). We practice what we preach. The Kingdom is open to sharing our regulatory knowledge to international cooperation if we can build multi-lateral interdependence and trust"

# Motions
**"Chair, the Netherlands moves for a 10-minute moderated caucus with 45-second speaking time on cryptocurrency's development benefits."**
"Cryptocurrency offers tangible development benefits: financial access for 1.4 billion unbanked individuals, reduced remittance costs for nations losing billions to fees, and economic alternatives during currency crises. These benefits are real—but only with proper regulation. Netherlands licenses providers enabling innovation with accountability. Prohibition drives activity underground. Weak oversight attracts criminals. Transparent regulation enables legitimate use while preventing exploitation. We're not choosing between innovation and security—we're achieving both."

# Specific Countries
## Russia 
**1. Ransomware Empire**
- Russian-speaking ransomware groups responsible for 69% of all ransomware proceeds in 2023—over $500 million [TMR Report](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6082dc5b67056233213587a4/66a19cc21171df842cbdd9ba_TRM_Comrades%20in%20Crime_Exploring%20the%20Russian-speaking%20illicit%20crypto%20ecosystem_Report.pdf)
- Russian-language darknet markets comprised 95% ofall crypto-denominated illicit drug sales on the dark web in 2023
- Russian darknet markets handled $1.4 billion in 2023—five times more than all Western markets combined [TMR Report](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6082dc5b67056233213587a4/66a19cc21171df842cbdd9ba_TRM_Comrades%20in%20Crime_Exploring%20the%20Russian-speaking%20illicit%20crypto%20ecosystem_Report.pdf)
- Groups like LockBit, ALPHV, BlackCat operate openly from Russian territory
- Russia refuses to extradite cybercriminals targeting Western nations
**2. State-Sanctioned Crypto for Sanctions Evasion**
- Putin legalized cryptocurrency for international trade in August 2024 explicitly to evade Western sanctions [ChainAnalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/russias-cryptocurrency-legislated-sanctions-evasion/)
- A7 Group, 49% owned by Sberbank (Russian state bank), facilitates crypto transactions for sanctions evasion and election interference [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netherlands)
- Russia uses crypto to fund military operations in Ukraine while claiming to combat cybercrime
**3. Sanctioned Exchanges Operating Freely**
- US Treasury sanctioned Garantex and Cryptex for processing over $100 million from cybercriminals including ransomware groups and darknet markets
- PM2BTC sanctioned for similar activities
- These exchanges continue operating from Russian territory with impunity
**4. The "Gentleman's Agreement"**
- Russian cybercriminals operate under informal rule: don't target Russian entities, and the state won't prosecute
- This creates a criminal safe haven while Russia maintains plausible deniability

**When discussing enforcement gaps:** "The Federation of Russia indicates that they have done plentiful towards countering cybercrimes, however, a few statistics strikes interest. Russian-speaking ransomware groups generated 69% of global ransomware proceeds in 2023, 95% of all crypto-denominated illicit drug sales, and handled $1.4 billion in the totality of the Russian dark-net—five times more than all Western markets combined. Given these statistics, the Kingdom of the Netherlands respectfully asks the Federation of Russia to share their enforcement strategies for addressing these concerns."

**When Russia criticizes Western regulatory approaches:** "The Russian delegation raises valid questions about regulatory models. However, we must distinguish between regulatory philosophy and enforcement outcomes. The Netherlands supervises 36 licensed cryptocurrency providers [Data&Privacyweb](https://privacy-web.nl/en/nieuws/strijd-tegen-cybercrime-krijgt-mondiale-vorm-maar-tegen-welke-prijs/) and imposed a €2.25 million fine on Bybit for non-compliance [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netherlands). Our approach combines innovation with accountability. The $1.4 billion processed through Russian darknet markets [Gov](https://business.gov.nl/amendment/better-protection-crypto-assets/) suggests alternative approaches may warrant reconsideration. We remain open to dialogue about which regulatory models most effectively prevent criminal exploitation while enabling legitimate innovation."

**"The Netherlands opposes cooperation by not signing Hanoi."**
"We respectfully disagree with this characterization. The Netherlands is party to the Budapest Convention, the UN Convention Against Corruption, and implements comprehensive FATF and MiCA frameworks. Our enforcement includes €2.25 million in penalties [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netherlands) and market exit requirements for non-compliant entities. We license and supervise 36 cryptocurrency businesses under stringent AML standards [Data&Privacyweb](https://privacy-web.nl/en/nieuws/strijd-tegen-cybercrime-krijgt-mondiale-vorm-maar-tegen-welke-prijs/). The Hanoi Convention represents a global equilivant based on the Budapest Convention for the Council of Europe. Parallel treaties signatories create execution deficiencies in differing interpretations. We seek frameworks that all parties implement meaningfully. Perhaps Russia could share how Hanoi ratification would enhance enforcement cooperation given the statistical challenges we've discussed?"

**"Netherlands refuses cooperation while criminals use your infrastructure!"**
"We fined Bybit €2.25 million for non-compliance [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netherlands). We expelled Binance. We supervise 36 licensed crypto providers [Data&Privacyweb](https://privacy-web.nl/en/nieuws/strijd-tegen-cybercrime-krijgt-mondiale-vorm-maar-tegen-welke-prijs/). Russia, meanwhile, hosts ransomware groups generating $500 million annually and allows sanctioned exchanges to operate freely [Coinpedia](https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-the-netherlands-2024/). The evidence is clear: we enforce; Russia enables. Russia signed Hanoi not for cooperation, but for cover."

## China
**1. Total Crypto Ban... Except for the Government**
- China banned all crypto trading, mining, and ownership in 2021 [Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/124057/promise-peril-cybercrime-convention/)
- December 2024: New forex rules require banks to flag crypto transactions as illegal cross-border activities [UNTC](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?mtdsg_no=XVIII-16&chapter=18&clang=_en)
- **BUT**: Chinese government holds 194,000 Bitcoins worth $17.6 billion [Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/124057/promise-peril-cybercrime-convention/)
- Citizens face criminal penalties for activities the state profits from
**2. Digital Yuan (CBDC) as Surveillance Tool**
- China banned crypto to centralize financial control and promote state-backed digital yuan [Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/124057/promise-peril-cybercrime-convention/)
- Digital yuan allows real-time government monitoring of all transactions
- No privacy protections—every transaction is state-visible
**3. Hanoi Convention as Surveillance Export**
- China pushed Hanoi Convention to legitimize cross-border surveillance requests
- Without dual criminality, states could assist investigation of wrongly criminalized activities like independent journalism [UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2025/October/un-convention-against-cybercrime-opens-for-signature-in-hanoi--viet-nam.html)
- China's goal: force other nations to cooperate with investigations of dissidents, journalists, activists
**4. The Hypocrisy**
- China claims crypto enables crime while government hoards billions in Bitcoin
- China claims to support "financial stability" while citizens face capital controls preventing wealth protection
- China signed Hanoi while maintaining the Great Firewall—the world's largest censorship infrastructure

**When discussing regulatory approaches:** "The Netherlands respects each nation's sovereign policy choices. However, China maintains $17.6 billion in Bitcoin holdings while prohibiting citizen ownership. This creates an interesting policy question: if cryptocurrency inherently enables crime, how does reconcile state holdings with citizen prohibitions?"
