**Chosen PT:**
In the production of knowledge, **does it matter** that **observation** is an *essential* but **flawed tool**? Discuss with reference to the **natural sciences** and one other area of knowledge.

**Reworded PT:**
==**Should** we be mindful that our **evidence** (observation) may not be **truthful** (flawed)?==

 

**AOK:**
Natural science and Arts.

**Response**
It depends on how the knowledge is produced and the intention of the knoweldge.
In the arts when we value subjective interpretation, whether the observation is flawed does not matter because observation is not an essential tool creativity and imagination are more valued.
However in the natural sciences when we value objectivity, it does matter 
# Introduction
This title comes with two assumptions. First is that observation is an essential tool in the production of knowledge, and second is that observation is a flawed tool. However this essay will argue that observation is an important tool in the production of knowledge but its necessity varies depending on the type of knowledge. In the natural sciences, observation plays a different role depending on experimental vs theoretical work, while in the arts, evaluative knowledge of art pieces often requires personal subjectivity instead of observations


To understand this title, we must first define what it means for observation to be flawed, and secondly, what it means for the essentiality and flaws of observation to matter in the production of knowledge. 

Firstly, observation can be argued to be the process of collecting objective evidence about the world and is often argued to be the foundation of the production of knowledge. This implies that when an observation is flawed, it diverts from the objectivity.
Secondly, whether something matters could be considered to depend solely on what the knowers value. If we derived some knowledge based on observation and we value objectivity , then yes, it does matter if the observations on which we build 

**Assumptions:**
- This title comes with two assumptions. 
- One is that observations is an essential tool in the production of knowledge and the second is that observation is a flawed tool. 
**Definitions:**
- Observation is the process of collecting empirical evidence and is often argued to be the foundation of the production of knowledge 
- In the natural sciences, the scientific method dictates observation through  collection of data of the natural world through observation using  
	- However knowledge may be produced in many other ways such as through imagination, for which the importance of observation is questionable.
- Similarly, in the arts, knowledge is created through the interpretation of art pieces, 
- Before analyzing this question, it is important to define what it means for something to matter. 
- Whether something matter, depends on how much we value it, or how important it is to acknowledge it. 
- If it matters that observation is an essential but flawed tool, it means that we should value the potential unreliability of evidence produced through observation.


# Natural Sciences
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
In the natural sciences, the scientific method dicitates it does matter that observation is an essential but flawed tool because the intention of knowledge is objectivity. Objectivity in the natural sciences is often regarded based on its alignment with physical reality.
**Implication:**
**Evaluation:**
Biases, Limitations, Uncertainties, Reliability, Subjectivity
**Example:**

**Alternative Perspective 1:**
However a counterargument is that in the natural sciences, it does not matter that observation is an essential but flawed tool as in areas that are theoretical, observation plays minimal role thus its , and reasoning and imagination are more crucial.
