# Introduction
This title comes with two assumptions: (1) observation is an essential tool in the production of knowledge, and (2) observation is a flawed tool. To understand this title, we must first define what it means for observation to be flawed, and what it means for the essentiality and flaws of observation to matter in the production of knowledge. 

Foremost, observation can be considered to be the process of collecting objective evidence about the world, which implies that when an observation is flawed, it diverts from the objectivity. Secondly, whether something matters could be considered to depend on what the knowers value. If in the natural sciences we derived some knowledge based on observation and we value its objectivity, then yes, it does matter if the observations is imperfect as that decrease the value of the knowledge. However if a piece of interpretive knowledge in the arts was produced, potential biases may matter less to knowers that value subjective interpretation more than objectivity. Let's explore this topic through the AOK of the Natural sciences and the Arts.

# Natural Sciences
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
Foremost, observation is genuinely essential to the production of knowledge in experimental natural sciences. Biologist can not logically derive cell theory from any first principals, and physicist can not prove the existence of Higgs Bosons without experimentally confirming it through particle colliders. The implication of this is that to study the natural world, observation is the only entry point for scientist to connect with the natural world. However, complication arises as observation is inevitably flawed, and is ultimately an inaccurate representation of the natural world, which raises questions about the truthfulness, usefulness, and value of scientific knowledge built on top of such flawed observations. This combination of (1) observation being essential to the production of the natural world, and (2) observation being inherently flawed matter profoundly in the natural sciences as this implies that scientist can not abandon observation, but they can also not trust it fully either. When scientists are obligated to use a flawed tool, it undermines the the certainty knowers can have on the applicability of their knowledge into real-world scenarios, which negatively impacts the valuation of scientific knowledge. 

**Example:**
Consider the example of *Helicobacter pylori* (a bacteria) and stomach ulcers. For decades, doctors (part of the natural science family) studied patients with stomach ulcers and deduced (created knowledge in the natural sciences) that its was linked to excessive acid in the stomach and hormonal complication caused by stress. Even though doctors studied the stomach tissues containing *H. pylori* directly with the bacterias visible, they continued to dismiss its effects as it is their theory that bacterias can not survive in stomach acids. Their observations was theory-laden and biased, which wasn't their incompetence, but an inevitable flawed in using observations as an essential tool to create knowledge, as we observe the natural world through the lens of our theories. Because observation is the only method to study stomach ulcers, and because their observation was flawed, millions of patients received wrongful medical care rendering the scientific knowledge produced valueless. 

**Implication:**
**Evaluation:**
What makes this essential-but-flawed paradox matter in the natural sciences isn't simply that scientific knowledge could be wrong, but that scientist have no alternatives. This implies a perpetual provisionality in the natural sciences, and that we are should always be uncertain of of scientific knowledge as it always probably wrong. However, it is important to recognize this paradox did not hinder the natural science despite its seemingly negative consequences, but instead pushed the for the development of the scientific method. Through repeated trials, double-blind testing, peer-review, etc., the natural science have became arguably the most objective field across all discipline. The essential-but-flawed reality of observation matters profoundly in this case as it shaped scientific methodologies to compensate for it, which ultimately increase the objectivity of the natural science elevating its value.

**Alternative Perspective:**
However, It is important to note that the previous argument implies a universality of reliance on the observation with the natural sciences. Although experimental natural sciences relies crucially on observations, theoretical natural sciences depend more on theory and logical deduction instead. Take theoretical physics, Albert Einstein develop the theories of relativity primarily through thought experiments, imagining falling elevators, speeding trains, and mathematical reasoning. His revolutionary theories were speculated well before empirical evidence could prove it. Here, the flaws of observation matters less because this position fundamentally challenges assumption #1 that observation is essential. This implies that even within the natural sciences, the paradox of essential-but-flawed observation have varied importance and applicability. Where observation creates knowledge (experimental natural sciences), flawed observations contaminates the knowledge; where observation confirms knowledge (theoretical knowledge), flawed observations impact acceptance. Nonetheless, the eventual need to validate theoretical speculations with empirical data highlights that the natural sciences can never fully escape from the flawed but essential nature of observations and that it matters. Theories that have not been proven empirically like String Theory, occupy a grey area where they can never be truly applied with certainty as knowers questions its reliability and usefulness.

# Arts
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
From a different perspectives, knowledge in the arts does not value objectivity as its core principal, and instead praises subjective interpretation. In the production of knowledge in the arts, whether fine art pieces or literature, the subjectivity of interpretation renders strict obedience to empirical characteristics of the world taken through observations, unnecessary. Often times observations are only taken as inspiration, and it is human creativity thats fills in the rest. This also implies that there is no correctness to observation that lead to the subsequent interpretation. If ten people interpreted ten different message from Shakespear's Hamlet, then the ten subjective are all equally valuable to the knowers and represent personal insights. Objective or not, truthful or not, artistic knowledge produced from these type of observation all equally valuable to knowers. Since the degree to which a observation is objective is not the largest determinant on the values of artistic knowledge, observation as a essential and flawed tools matters less. 

**Example:**
Artistic knowledge doesn't seek objectivity to the corresponding reality that it represents, and instead it values the subjective interpretation, emotional expression, and imagination. Take Picasso's *Guernica* for example. [![Guernica (Picasso) - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/PicassoGuernica.jpg) 
It did not require photographic accuracy to represent that horrors of the bombing of Guernica yet audience perceive this image through their own eyes (observation) and can infer tragedy that took place. To the audience, the distorted, subjectively filtered painting allowed for an un-objective and flawed observation of the bombing of Guernica through the painting, yet its flaws arguably conveyed more artistic truth then realism could alone. Indeed, observation was necessary to generate the interpretative knowledge of the the painting, but the flawed nature of the observation did not hinder the value of the artistic knowledge, it enhanced it. The flawed observation of each knower of this art piece allows for the formation of distinct interpretative knowledge. Some knowers views Christian symbolism, anti-facist political critiques, or universal suffering, which are all legitimate. This suggests that observation being essential-but-flawed matters less in the arts because subjectivity is valued more. If there is no correct, objective observation to aim for, it is inconsequential that observation may be flawed. 

**Evaluation:**
**Implication:**
However, this argument oversimplifies and ignores the complex dynamics of how observation shapes artistic knowledge. While arts doesn't demand observational accuracy, observation's quality still impacts the boundaries of what can be imagined. It can be argued that we can not conceive what we have not observed and even works considered purely imaginal are but combination and transformation of observed events of the artists. This implies that the essential-but-flawed nature of observation still matters in the arts, as observation undermines creativity and subjective interpretation. Thus flaws of observation propagates through imaginative works of art, limiting not what the artists represents, but what the artists can conceive of representing. 

**Alternative Perspective:**
Furthermore, knowledge in arts exists at two level: first artists must observe to create *art pieces*, and second audiences must observe make *interpretations*. Consider the creation side of historical western paintings, which were dominant by male artists for centuries whose observation of women were limited and biased, filtered through gender-norms and stereotypic shaped by patriarchal systems. These flawed observation of female experiences weren't just "wrong" they fundamentally limits the artists imaginative possibility in creating art pieces. It has been argued that it is impossible to conceive an idea without first observing it. The implication of this is that entire categories of knowledge about rich female protagonist were impossible to produce. Although readers could interpret these works, their interpretative possibilities is limited by the biased observation that led to creation of these art pieces. Complex female territory such as professional ambition, political advocacy, and embodied experiences like child birth remains absent from knower's interpretation due to the limitation in the observation of the artists. This matters because the essential-but-flawed paradox limits the scope of the artistic knowledge. On the interpretative side, knowers' depend on what is available to interpret, which depends on observations that underline artistic creation. 

# Conclusion
Overall, whether the essential-but-flawed nature of observation matters, or have strong consequences on the usefulness of some knowledge, depends strongly on the what the knowers in that domain values. In the natural sciences where objectivity is value strongly and observation is genuinely unavoidable, the essential-but-flawed paradox creates indispensable epistemic compromises that shape the whole discipline. Where subjectivity is considered as important or even more than objectivity in the arts, the importance of objective observation is undermined, however still defines the boundary on what is imaginatively possible.
