In the production of knowledge, **does it matter** that **observation** is an *essential* but **flawed tool**? Discuss with reference to the **natural sciences** and one other area of knowledge.

# Introduction
This title comes with two assumptions: (1) observation is an essential tool in the production of knowledge, and (2) observation is a flawed tool. To understand this title, we must first define what it means for observation to be flawed, and what it means for the essentiality and flaws of observation to matter in the production of knowledge. 

Foremost, observation can be considered to be the process of collecting objective evidence about the world, which suggests that flawed observation involves some diversion from objectivity. Whether this matter, however, could be considered to depend on what the knowers value. In the natural sciences where objectivity is praised, flawed observations matters profoundly as it's imperfection decrease the value of knowledge. However, in the arts, where subjectivity is often crucial, potential biases may matter less. This essay will explore this topic through the AOK of the Natural sciences and the Arts.

# Natural Sciences
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
In the experimental Natural Sciences, observation is genuinely essential to the production of knowledge. Biologist can not logically derive cell theory from any first principals, and physicist can not prove the existence of Higgs Bosons without experimentally confirming it through particle colliders. The implication of this is that: observation is the only entry point for scientist to connect with the natural world. However, complication arises as observation is inevitably flawed to some extend, which raises questions about the truthfulness, usefulness, and value of scientific knowledge built on top of such flawed observations. This combination of (1) observation being essential to the production of knowledge of the natural world, and (2) observation being inherently flawed matter profoundly in the natural sciences as this suggests that scientist can not abandon observation, yet can never trust it fully either. When scientists are obligated to use a flawed tool, it undermines the the certainty knowers can have on the applicability of their knowledge into real-world scenarios, which negatively impacts the valuation of scientific knowledge. 

**Example:**
Consider the example of *Helicobacter pylori* (a bacteria) and stomach ulcers. For decades, doctors studied patients with stomach ulcers and deduced that its was linked to excessive acid in the stomach and hormonal complication caused by stress. In 1950, researchers examined over 1000 gastric biosies and found no bacteria, even though now we know at least half of the patients must have been infected. Current speculations follows that this observational failure is have been caused by wrong staining techniques or culturing procedure. Their observations was fundamentally wrong, forcing them to not see bacterias that were actually there, and to prescribe antacids and lifestyle changes when antibiotics would have been the most effective cure^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2432/],[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1246068/]. Because observation is the only method to study stomach ulcers, and because their observation was flawed, millions of patients received wrongful medical care rendering the scientific knowledge produced without applicational value. 

[{>>Is this Implication enough? Does Evaluation show enough alternative perspectives?<<}]**Implication, Evaluation:**
What makes this essential-but-flawed paradox matter in the natural sciences isn't simply that scientific knowledge could be wrong, but that scientist have no alternatives. This implies a perpetual provisionality in the natural sciences, and that we should always be uncertain of scientific knowledge no matter how much support it have. However, it is important to recognize this paradox did not hinder the natural science despite its seemingly negative consequences, but instead pushed the for the development of the scientific method to counter this uncertainty. Through repeated trials, double-blind testing, peer-review, etc., the natural science have became arguably one of the most objective field across all discipline. The essential-but-flawed reality of observation matters profoundly in this case as it shaped scientific methodologies to compensate for it, ultimately bring arguably high objectivity to the natural sciences.

**Alternative Perspective:**
However, It is important to note that the previous argument implies a universality of reliance on the observation with the natural sciences. Although experimental natural sciences relies crucially on observations, theoretical natural sciences depend more on theory and logical deduction instead. Take theoretical physics, Albert Einstein develop the theories of relativity primarily through thought experiments, imagining falling elevators, speeding trains, and mathematical reasoning. His revolutionary theories were speculated well before empirical evidence could prove it. Here, the flaws of observation matters less because this position fundamentally challenges assumption #1 that observation is essential. This implies that even within the natural sciences, the paradox of essential-but-flawed observation have varied importance and applicability. Where observation creates knowledge (experimental natural sciences), flawed observations contaminates the knowledge; where observation confirms knowledge (theoretical knowledge), flawed observations impact acceptance. Nonetheless, the eventual need to validate theoretical speculations with empirical data highlights that the natural sciences can never fully escape from the flawed but essential nature of observations and that it matters. Theories that have not been proven empirically like String Theory, occupy a grey area where they can never be truly applied with certainty as knowers questions its reliability and usefulness.

# Arts
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
From a different perspectives, knowledge in the arts does not value objectivity as its core principal, and instead often praises subjective interpretation. In the production of knowledge in the arts, whether fine art pieces or literature, the subjectivity of interpretation renders strict obedience to empirical characteristics of the world taken through observations less necessary. Often times observations are only taken as inspiration, and it is human creativity thats fills in the rest. Since the degree to which a observation is objective is not the largest determinant on the values of artistic knowledge, observation as a essential and flawed tools matters less. 

**Example:**
Artistic knowledge often don't seek objectivity to the corresponding reality that it represents, and instead depends heavily on the subjective interpretation, emotional expression, and imagination. This fundamentally changes how observation's flaws propagate. Take Picasso's *Guernica* for example. [![Guernica (Picasso) - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/PicassoGuernica.jpg) 
When multiple knowers observe the painting, they may see fundamentally different elements. Some may see a bull first, another, the light bulb, while others with vision deficiency may perceive tonal contrasts drastically differently and in differently lighting, the colours may appear different. These are all genuine observational variations, not just interpretative differences, but they lead to different interpretative knowledge. Unlike the Natural Sciences where observational flaws undermine values of knowledge (doctors missing H. Pylori leading to invalid prescription), varied observation in the arts are often all considered legitimate knowledge. The flawed observation of each knower of this art piece allows for the formation of distinct interpretative knowledge. Some knowers may view Christian symbolism, anti-facist political critiques, while other see universal suffering, which are all legitimate knowledge originating from different, and potentially flawed, observations. This suggests that observation being essential-but-flawed matters less in the arts because subjectivity is valued more, flaws become a feature, rather than an issue.

**Evaluation, Implication:**
However, this argument oversimplifies and ignores the complex dynamics of how observation shapes artistic knowledge. While arts doesn't demand observational accuracy, observation's quality still impacts the boundaries of what can be imagined. It can be argued that it is impossible to conceive what have not been observed and even works considered purely imaginal are but combination and transformation of observed events of the artists. This implies that the essential-but-flawed nature of observation still matters in the arts, as observation undermines creativity and subjective interpretation. Thus flaws of observation propagates through imaginative works of art, limiting not what the artists represents, but what the artists can conceive of representing. 

**Alternative Perspective:**
Furthermore, knowledge in arts exists at two level: first artists must observe to create *art pieces*, and second audiences must observe make *interpretations*. Now consider the creation side of historical western paintings, which were dominant by male artists for centuries whose observation of women were limited and biased, filtered through gender-norms and stereotypic shaped by patriarchal systems. These flawed observation of female experiences weren't just "wrong" they fundamentally limits the artists imaginative possibility creating art pieces. It has been argued that it is impossible to conceive an idea without first observing it. The implication of this is that entire categories of knowledge about rich female protagonist were impossible to produce. Although readers could interpret the male-dominant works, their interpretative possibilities is limited by the partial observation that led to creation of these art pieces. Complex female territory such as professional ambition, political advocacy, and embodied experiences like child birth remains absent from knower's interpretation due to the limitation in the observation of the artists. This matters because the essential-but-flawed paradox limits the scope of the artistic knowledge. On the interpretative side, knowers' depend on what is available to interpret, which depends on observations that underline artistic creation. 

# Conclusion
Overall, whether the essential-but-flawed nature of observation matters, or have strong consequences on the usefulness of some knowledge, depends strongly on the what the knowers in that domain values. In the natural sciences where objectivity is valued strongly and observation is genuinely unavoidable, the essential-but-flawed paradox creates indispensable epistemic compromises that shape the whole discipline. Where subjectivity is considered as or even more important than objectivity in the arts, the importance of objective observation is undermined, however still defines the boundary on what is imaginatively possible.
