In the production of knowledge, **does it matter** that **observation** is an *essential* but **flawed** **tool?** Discuss with reference to the natural sciences and one other area of knowledge.
1. **Does it matter** that our **observations** could be (all) **wrong**?
2. **Does it matter** that our evidence may not **accurately** describe the **truth**?

1. In the production of knowledge, **does it matter** that **observation** is an *essential* but **flawed tool**? Discuss with reference to the **natural sciences** and one other area of knowledge. (Should we be mindful that our **evidence** may not be **truthful**?)
	- *In the production of knowledge specifically*, observation is the process that produces empirical data about the world, which can serve as a foundation on the production *new* knowledge.
	- Knowledge in the Natural Sciences is often an understanding that approximates the of the natural world as close as possible. 
	- Knowledge in the Arts is something that is intended to be interpreted by a human through emotions, as opposed to knowledge in other areas which may be intended to be taken directly through and through logic, such as the Natural Science.
	- In the production of knowledge in the Natural Sciences, observations is the process that collects empirical data about the natural world through sensory instruments, (whether biological, mechanistic, or something else) which is then interpreted and can serve as the foundation production of new knowledge.
	- In the production of knowledge in the Arts, observations is the process of perceiving empirical characteristics of the world, (ie. of the natural world, of the mental world, of other art, of emotion, etc.) which is then interpreted and can inspire production of new knowledge. 
	- In the Natural Sciences, the goal is often, but not necessarily in all cases, to produce knowledge that approximate the natural world as close as possible. 
	- In the Arts, 

2. To what extent do you agree that **doubt** is **central** to the pursuit of knowledge? Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge. (Is challenging established truth the main way of creating new knowledge?)
	- Doubt invites peer-review and validation which legitimizes or de-establishes knowledge in the Natural Sciences. Doubt is central in the pursuit of knowledge in the Natural Sciences when it deals with verifications.
	- Accidental revelation is equally prevalent as doubt in the pursuit of knowledge. Doubt is not central in the pursuit of knowledge in the Natural Sciences when dealing with creations.
	- Excessive doubt leads to conspiracies and deteriorate trust. Conspiracies doesn't aid in pursuit of knowledge.

# Selected Title
1. In the production of knowledge, **does it matter** that **observation** is an *essential* but **flawed tool**? Discuss with reference to the **natural sciences** and one other area of knowledge. (Should we be mindful that our **evidence** may not be **truthful**?)
	- Key assumptions: Observation is a tool, it is essential, and it is flawed.
	- Knowledge in the Natural Sciences are understandings that approximates the natural world as close as possible that is intended to be interpreted literally. 
	- Knowledge in the Arts is something that is intended to be interpreted by a human through emotions, as opposed to knowledge in other areas which may be intended to be taken directly and through logic, such as the Natural Science.
		- [doesn't necesillary have to be included, good to know what knowledge is in art]
		- [in art, usually interpertation is the knowledge]

	- *In the production of knowledge specifically*, observation is the process that produces empirical data about the world, which can serve as a foundation for the production *new* knowledge.

	- In the production of knowledge in the Natural Sciences, observations is the process that collects empirical data about the natural world through sensory instruments, (whether biological, mechanistic, or something else) which is then interpreted and can serve as the foundation production of new knowledge.
	- In the production of knowledge in the Arts, observations is the process of perceiving empirical characteristics of the world, (ie. of the natural world, of the mental world, of other art, of emotion, etc.) which is then interpreted and can inspire production of new knowledge. 
		- [better than diciontary definition]

	- By the nature of knowledge in the Natural Science being an approximation of the natural world, it is an expectation that knowledge produced conform to observations (empirical data, or evidence) of the natural world, and it is equally expected that observations of the natural world lies as closely as possible to the truth. 
		- This is because knowledge in the Natural Science attempts to approximate the natural world, thus it is preferable that knowledge in the Natural Science lies as close as possible to the natural world.
		- Thus observations being essential but flawed matters as it impacts the certainty and reliability of knowledge produced.
		- Observation's potential fallacies in the Natural Science also matter as knowledge in the Natural Science are often tested against in the natural world. Such testing, either for verification (peer-review) or application of the knowledge will create new observations that the knowledge is compared against, which can validate whether the knowledge align with the rules of the natural world. A knowledge that does not align with the new observations will be dismissed wrong showcasing how observation's flaw is crucial in the Natural Science.
		- However due to the essentialness of observation of the natural world in producing knowledge in the Natural Science
		- The usefulness of knowledge in the Natural Science also depend highly on whether that knowledge can be applied. If knowledge
		- Application of knowledge in the Natural Sciences are repeatedly tested and verified against new observations, and thus it is important they acknowledge the potential flaw in the initial observations.
		- blah blah instruments of observations can be flawed
		- ethics blah blah safety of application
		- [consdier a what is a flaw tool, accuracy? not be the truth?]
		- [functionality of these knowledge]
		- [methodology: scientific method -> repeated testing -> naunce(shows how it works in the real word)]
			- [we need to acknowloedge and heres how we do it]
	- Knowledge in the Arts, on the contrary is designed to be interpreted by humans through emotions. This subjectivity of interpretation renders strict obedience to empirical characteristics of the world taken through observations, unnecessary. Often times observations are only taken as inspiration, and it is human creativity thats fills in the rest.
		- Knowledge in the Arts are rarely verifiable and can not be compared to the original observations that underlined its creation. Faking observations, a fatal flaw in the Natural Science, is held to a lesser extend in the Arts and is simply called creativity, which is often praised as an essential quality of an artist. Thus it is not important that observations that underlined the creation of knowledge in the Arts may be flawed.
		- However deviation of the Arts the real world due to flaws in the observations may cause ethical concerns as it may create misleading knowledge that proliferate negative consequences on the perceivers. Depending on the intentions of production of a specific piece of knowledge in the Arts, a flawed depiction of the world, through the authors bias, accidental misobservation, etc., can create meaningful results

**More ideas**
- [observation in difference AOK is good]
- [what does flaw means mean for each AOK]
	- [could do in otrudction or in each argument ]
- [discuss assumptions of tools as essential]
	- [could challenge in the conclusion]
- scope method ethics
	- [touched on ]
	- [intentions of knowledge producer ]
	- [methods touched in art]
	- [mean to legitimize in the science] 
	- effectiveness of knowledge 
	- role of evidence
	- relation to wider cultural norms
- [should be a "depnds on..." questions ]
	- function
	- if flaws are more importnat than observations
	- methods avaliable to produce 
	- sometimes observation is the only things we had -> that's the only things
