# Introduction
This title comes with two assumptions: (1) observation is an essential tool in the production of knowledge, and (2) observation is a flawed tool. To understand this title, we must first define what it means for observation to be flawed, and what it means for the essentiality and flaws of observation to matter in the production of knowledge. 

Foremost, observation can be argued to be the process of collecting objective evidence about the world, which implies that when an observation is flawed, it diverts from the objectivity. Secondly, whether something matters could be considered to depend on what the knowers value. If in the natural sciences we derived some knowledge based on observation and we value its objectivity, then yes, it does matter if the observations is imperfect. However if a piece of interpretive knowledge in the arts was produced, potential biases may matter less to knowers that value subjective interpretation more than objectivity.

# Natural Sciences
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
By the nature of knowledge in the Natural Science being an approximation of the natural world, it is an expectation that this type of knowledge be as objective as possible. This is achieve through the scientific method. [elaborate on scientific method] Since the intention of production of experimental knowledge in the natural sciences is to strive for objectivity, the flaws in observation strongly impacts the value of experimental knowledge in the natural sciences, and thus observation as a essential and flawed tools matters strongly.
**Implication:**
This implies that a strong emphasis on the reduction of flaws in observation be taken in the natural sciences. This can be observed in rigorous protocols (peer review, replication, double-blind studies) in the natural sciences that is developed to compensate, and to increase objectivity. 
- scientific can never achieve true objectivity because flaws in observation can never be fundamentally removes
**Evaluation:**
However limitations remains as this argument implies a universality of flaws in observation. Under the assumption that flaws are inevitable, the natural sciences is surprisingly successful in producing knowledge of value. Thus, whether the flawed nature of observations matters depends on on the type of flaws. Extremely small imprecision in observation below the level of usefulness are still inherently un-objectivity in the observation, but its impact on the values of scientific knowledge is limited.

**Alternative Perspective 1:**
However it is important to consider than even with the natural sciences, many strands focuses on theory instead. Theoretical knowledge in the natural sciences are formed on the basis of unproved conjectures that aims to fill in the gaps of incomplete observation with our best possible guesses. This type of knowledge depends largely on inductive reasoning, and the role of observation falls short. Since the method of production of theoretical knowledge in the natural sciences is based largely not on observation, observation's flaws have little impact on the values of this type of knowledge, thus observation as a essential and flawed tools matters less. 
**Implication:**
This implies that in the domain of theoretical knowledge, wrongful initial assumptions and conjectures may be of a bigger impact on the objectivity of the knowledge produced than flawed observations.
**Evaluation:**
However, although theoretical knowledge does not rely heavily on the empirical evidence, theoretical knowledge still originates from observation to an extend. It is impossible to conceive an idea of the natural world without first observing it.

# Arts
**Knowledge Claim 1:**
From a different perspectives, knowledge in the arts does not value objectivity as its core principal, and instead praises subjective interpretation. In the production of knowledge in the arts, whether fine art pieces, literature, etc., the subjectivity of interpretation renders strict obedience to empirical characteristics of the world taken through observations, unnecessary. Often times observations are only taken as inspiration, and it is human creativity thats fills in the rest. This also implies that there is no correctness to observation that acted as inspiration. Objective or not, truthful or not, artistic knowledge produced from these type of observation all equally valuable to knowers. Since the degree to which a observation is objective and the extend to which this observation is used are both not the largest determinant on the values of artistic knowledge, observation as a essential and flawed tools matters less.

**Alternative Perspective 1:**
However, a counter argument to the dependence on imagination and creativity is that although they play a strong role in shaping the production of artistic knowledge, artists ultimately base their imaginative work in observed experience. Painters observe lighting and form, novelist observe human relation and behaviours, and musicians observe patterns and human responses. It is argued that one can not conceive meaning and ideas without first observing the external world. [talk about the creativity lesson] Although observation is not the only key factor in production of artistic knowledge as imagination also plays a huge role, observation ultimately shape imagination. [biases observation produce biases representation, which in return limits imagination] Flawed observation doesn't just produce inaccurate representation, they limit the scope of possible imaginations. Since the knowers in the arts strongly values the creative possibility of the arts, flawed observations limit the values of artistic knowledge, thus it matters that observation is a essential but flawed tool.
