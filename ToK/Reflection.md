# First Reflection
After exploring the titles, I picked title 1 as I believed it was the most nuanced. The mandatory AOK is the natural science, and I picked the other AOK of Arts as I believed it provided contrast. The interaction revealed that I could explore the assumptions in the title, like the essentiality of observation. We also acknowledge that the intention of the producing knowledge is also important to consider. Since I already have 2 knowledge arguments, my next steps were to build nuance into them as well as consider new perspectives/arguments that would contribute to a more nuanced response.
