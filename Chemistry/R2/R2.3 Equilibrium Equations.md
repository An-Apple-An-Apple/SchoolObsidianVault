# R2.3.1 Equilibrium
- Forward and backward reaction both happen and at the same speed. (Dynamic)
- Occur in closed system. With a reversible reaction
- Microscopically reacting but Macroscopically stable. 
- Physical equilibrium (state Equilibrium).
- Chemical equilibrium.
	- Rate equal.
	- Concentration differs.
# R2.3.2-3 Equilibrium Constant (K)
- K is $$\frac{\sum{(products)^{coeff}}}{\sum{(reactants)^{ceoff}}}$$ or commonly $$\frac{[A]^a[B]^b}{[C]^c[D]^d}$$ for $$aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC+dD$$

# R2.3.4 Le Châtelier's Principal
- A equilibrium will shift in in a way that counteract any changes to the equilibrium.
- When increasing concentration of a substance, the reaction will shift away from that side of the reaction.
- When pressure is increased, the reaction will shift in a way that decrease number of moles of gas. Doesn't move if amount of moles is the same.
- When temperature is increase, the reaction will favour the endothermic direction
- When temperature change, K change in the same direction as the reaction.
- Catalyst doesn't do anything
# R2.3.5 Reaction Quotient
- literally calculate the same way as K but for when the reaction is not at equilibrium
- if Q\<K reaction goes to the right
- if Q\>K reaction goes to the left
- if Q=K reaction is at equilibrium and reaction doesn't move
# R2.3.6 ICE Table
- ICE Table: Initial, Change, Equilibrium (Concentrations for each species)
	- Change in concentration from initial to equilibrium is proportional to the coefficients.
	- In the reaction $aA + bB \leftrightharpoons cC + dD$, if $\Delta[A]=x$, then $\Delta[B]=b\frac{x}{a}$
	- Change in concentration from initial to equilibrium is of different sign in reactants and products.
- Type 1: given initial concentration, one equilibrium concentration, find final equilibrium concentration and K.
- Type 2: given initial concentration, and K, find equilibrium.
	- Let x/-x times coefficients be the change in concentration since a numeric value can't be found
	- The need to solve quadratic would be specifically avoided.
- Type 3: given initial concentration, and small K, find equilibrium.
	- The need to solve quadratic would not be avoided.
	- Work around is to assume equilibrium concentration of reactants and their initial concentration is the same because equilibrium lies very much to the left
# R2.3.7
- Gibbs energy is a from of potential energy
- Just use the two equation on the formula booklet
- Higher Gibbs energy means less spontaneous, means lower K
- Note: for $\Delta G\textdegree$, assume 1M of everything. Therefore it starts at a specific position on the graph. Drawing a line from the all reactants to all products then shifting that line to touch the graph at one point, that point is where the reactions starts.
- For $\Delta G$, then it can start anywhere
