# R2.2.1 Rate of Reaction
$$\text{rate}=\frac{\Delta{[A]}}{t}$$
- anything that relates to the amount of reactants or products can be measured
	- ie. mass, volume (gas), colour
	- the units may differ
	- by convention positive
- slope of concentration vs time is rate
# R2.2.2-3 Factors affecting Rate
$$\text{rate of reaction}=\text{frequency of collision}\times\text{fraction of sucessful collision}$$
- successful collision requires enough energy, and correct orientation
- **temperature** increase kinetic energy, increase speed, increase frequency and fraction of successful collision
	- small temperature dif -> big rate dif
	- big concentration dif -> small rate dif
- **concentration** increase frequency
	- if concentration that is increase is of reactant that is limiting, the yield also increases
- **pressure** increases concentration, increase frequency
- **catalyst** increase successful collision by decreasing activation energy and help with orientation
- **surface area** of heterogeneous reactions increase frequency of reaction 
# R2.2.4-5 Energy Profile and Maxwell-Boltzman Distribution 
- Energy diagram shows activation energy
- Catalyze decrease activation energy
- Transition State (Activated Complex) is at the top of the curve
![[Energy Diagram with Catalyst.png]]
- Maxwell-Boltzman diagram shows the number particles at each energy
	- Activation energy is a line
	- Increasing temperature shift the graph to the right and lowest the max height
		- Therefore more particles have energy beyond the line and can react
	- Adding catalyst decrease the activation energy and move the line to the left
		- Therefore more particles have energy beyond the line and can react

# R2.2.6 Reaction Mechanism
- reaction don't happen in one step, the go through a reaction mechanism (multiple steps)
- each single step is called a elementary step
- use funnel analogy to know that there is always a rate limiting step, which is also the slowest
![[Funnel - Rate Limiting Step.png]]
- there may be [intermediates]
- use jumping analogy, reactant is when you start on both feet, transition states are in the air, intermediates step is when you land on one feet, product is when you finish and land on both feet
- [intermediates] (blue) are more stable than [transition states] (yellow)
	- on local minimum of energy profile
	- [intermediates] can sometimes be isolated, a regular compound with all bonds formed and broken
	- [transition states] can never be isolated, have certain bond open and some formed

# R2.2.7-8 Energy Profile Diagram and Molecularity
- Energy diagram includes reactants, products, transitions states, and intermediates, activation energy (including overall), and enthalpy
- step with highest activation energy is the rate determining step
![[Multistep Energy Profile with step.png]]
- molecularity is the number of species reacting in a step (just the sum of the coefficients of the reactants)
# R2.2.9 Rate of Reaction and Experimental Determination
$$\text{rate} = k[A]^a[B]^b$$
- we can change the concentration of A and B and see what the change in the rate is to determine a and b
# R2.2.10-11
- there's two graphs: concentraion vs time and rate vs concentration
![[2 Type Graphs vs Order.png]]
- when looking at elementary steps, the coefficient of the present reactants represent the reaction order
	- $aA + bB \dashrightarrow C + D$
	- $\text{rate} = k[A]^a[B]^b$
- for the full rate formula, start at the rate limiting step and find the rate equation, then replace the intermediates with what forms it
	-  $aA + bB \dashrightarrow cC + dD$      (fast)
	- $cC + fF \dashrightarrow eE$                (slow)
	- $\text{rate} = k[C]^c[F]^f = k[A]^a[B]^b[F]^f$
- k have different u. its: $$\frac{M}{M^{\text{order of reaction}}s}$$ where M is molarity (Mol/L)
# R2.2.12-13 Arrhenius Equation
- Arrhenius Equation $$k=Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}$$
- collision depends on [frequency] of collision and fraction of effective collision
- effective collision is affected by [concentration], (pressure — irrelevant for liquids), [temperature], [catalyst], (size — irrelevant for liquids)
- the rate equation is $k[A][B]$
	- $[A][B]$ is the [concentration]
	- A in K is the [frequency] at correct **orientation**
	- $e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}$ is the [temperature] and [catalyst]
- Linear form $$lnk = -\frac{E_a}{R}\frac{1}{T}+lnA$$
- $k$ can be determined experimentally by varying $T$ 
	- $E_a$ can be determined through the slope 
	- $A$ can be determined through substitution or intercept
- Point Form $$ln\frac{k_1}{k_2}=\frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{A_2}-\frac{1}{A_1}\right)$$
