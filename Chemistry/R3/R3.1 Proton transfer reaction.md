# R3.1.1 Brønsted–Lowry acids and bases
- Acids are proton donors
- Bases are proton acceptors
- Proton: $H^+$ exists in water as $H_3O^+$
- Acids contains hydrogen
	- monoprotic, diprotic, triprotic for having 1, 2, 3, hydrogen
	- Binary Acids with a halides - strong
	- Oxyacids with a polyatomic containing oxygen - depends
	- Organic Acids with a carboxyl group - weak 
- Bases contain lone pair of electron
	- Oxides - weak
	- Hydroxides - strong
	- Carbonates - weak
	- Hydrogen carbonates - weak
	- Ammonia, Amine (N bonded to H), Amide (N bonded to C=O)
# R3.1.2-3 Conjugate and Amphiprotic
- Conjugate acid-base pairs in reversible reaction
- Amphiprotic is base acid and base
- Water-soluble bases are care alkalis

# R3.1.4-5 Calculations of pH
- $\mathbf{pH=-log_{10}{[H^+]}}$ 
- $\mathbf{pOH=-log_{10}[OH^-] }$
- $pOH=-log_{10}{[OH^-]}$
	- acidic if $[H^+]$ > $[OH^-]$ or pH < 7
	- neutral if $[H^+]$ = $[OH^-]$ or pH = 7
	- basic if $[H^+]$ > $[OH^-]$ or pH > 7
- $\mathbf{pH+pOH=14}$ 
- Auto-ionization of water: $H_2O\leftrightharpoons{H_3O^+}+{OH^-}$  
	- $K_c=\mathbf{K_w=[H+][OH^-]}=1\times10^{-14}M$ at 25C or 298K
	- neutral solution $[H+]=[OH^-]=1\times10^{-7}M$ 
	- increasing $[H_3O^+]$ would shift reaction left ([[R2.3 Equilibrium Equations#R2.3.4 Le Châtelier's Principal|Le Châtelier's Principal]])
		- however minimal $[OH^-]$ means it won't shift much
		- $\Delta[OH^-]$ is significant, $\Delta[H_3O^+]$ is not
		- and vice versa
	- Since $K_w$ at any temperature is constant, increasing $[H^+]$ increase $[OH^-]$ and vice versa
- Sigfig of pH only counts right of the decimal place
# R3.1.6 Strong and Weak Acids and Bases
- Strong acids and bases ionizes completely, weak acids and bases don't
	- Concentration of H or OH in strong solutions is equal to initial acid/base concentrations
- Strong Acids
	- $HCl$, $HBr$, $HI$
	- $HNO_3$, $HCLO_4$, $H_2SO_4$
	- Sulphuric acid is strong for first ionization and weak for second
- Strong Bases
	- Alkali Metal Hydroxides
	- Calcium Hydroxides down
- Equilibrium position lies far to the right for strong acid/base dissociation
- In neutralization reaction, the equilibrium position can be determined based on the relative strength of the acids and the relative strength of the bases. The weaker base and weaker acids should be on the same side
- Concentration of acids/base (initial) and the strength of acid both impact the pH
- Higher the strength of acids, higher the ionization, lower the pH, higher the conductivity, faster the reaction, 
	- Base is the same but opposite
- Stronger the acid/base, weaker the conjugate
	- think of equilibrium position of dissociation
# R3.1.7 Neutralization Reaction 
- Acid reacts with Metal-Oxides and Metal-Hydroxides in double displacement to form a salt and water.
- Acid reacts with Metal-Carbonate and Metal-Hydrogen Carbonate to form a salt, water, and carbon dioxide.
# R3.1.8 Strong Acid-Base Titration
- See. [[R3.1 Proton transfer reaction#R3.1.13 Strong and Weak Acid-Base Titration|R3.1.13 Strong and Weak Acid-Base Titration]]
- Equivalence point is when the titrant and analyate exactly neutralize. 
- Endpoint is when an indicator changes colour. 
- Equivalence point is half-way up the steepest part of the titration curve or, if proper indicator is selected, around the endpoint.
- In a Strong-Acid-Base Titration, the equivalence have pH of 7.

# R3.1.12 Salt Hydrolization
- Salt dissociates into ion
	- Cations are formed by bases (gaining a H+)
	- Anions are formed by acids (removing a H+)
- If base is weak, cations hydrolyze water to create these base, creating $H_3O^+$, decrease pH
	- $NH_4^+ + H_2O \leftrightharpoons NH_3 + H_3O^+$   
- If base is strong, cations can't hydrolyze water, and can't affect the pH
	- $Na^+ + 2H_2O \leftarrow NaOH + H_3O^+$
- If acid is weak, anions hydrolyze water to create acids, creating $OH^-$, increase pH
	- $CH_3COO^- + H_3O \leftrightharpoons CH_3COOH + OH^-$ 
- If acid is strong, anions can't hydrolyze water, and can't affect the pH
	- $Cl^- + H_2O \leftarrow HCL + OH^-$ 

- Strong Acid + Strong Base -> Neutral
- Strong Acid + Weak Base -> Acidic
- Weak Acid + Strong Base -> Basic
- Weak Acid + Weak Base
	- The one that dissociates into ions less means its easier for their respective ion to hydrolyze into
	- The weaker one is more prominent because their ions hydrolyzed more
# R3.1.13 Strong and Weak Acid-Base Titration
- See [[R3.1 Proton transfer reaction#R3.1.8 Strong Acid-Base Titration|R3.1.8 Strong Acid-Base Titration]]
- Weak acid with strong base:![[W Acid with S Base Titration.jpg]]
	- **Before equilibrium**, there is no OH- present:
$$
HA \leftrightharpoons H^+ + A-
$$
	- When we add any strong base base, $OH^-$ is neutralized:
$$
OH^- + H+ \rightarrow H_2O
$$
	- We can find the $pH$ via $K_a$ (Henderson-Hasselbalch equation)
$$
K_a =\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}
$$
$$
K_a\frac{[HA]}{[A^-]}=[H^+]
$$
$$
\mathbf{pH=pK_a+log\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}
$$
	- Since $[A^-]$ increase and $[HA]$ decreases, by Le Chatelier's principle, equilibrium should try to reestablish, and $[H^+]$ would go down. But since new equilibrium keeps $\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ relatively stable, $\Delta log\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ is small so pH change is small. 
	- This creates a [buffer region].
	- At **half equivalence**, half the $OH^-$ necessary to neutralize all of $HA$ is used up, so half of $HA$ is also used up and converted to $A^-$ (in a one to one ratio). This means $[HA]=[A^-]$. (Note: the self-ionization of $HA$ into $A^-$ is negligible). Therefore
$$
pH=pK_a+log(1)
$$
$$
\mathbf{pH=pK_a}
$$
	- This can also be proven:
$$
K_a =\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}
$$
$$
K_a =[H^+]
$$
$$
pK_a = pH
$$
	- **At equivalence**, all $OH^-$ and $HA$ is used up, and only $A^-$ remains. $A^-$ hydrolyze to produce $OH-$ making the pH at equivalence higher than 7.
$$
	A^- + H_2O \rightarrow HA + OH^-
$$
$$
K_{b(A^-)}=\frac{[OH^-][HA]}{[A^-]} \hspace{5mm}\text{where}\hspace{5mm} K_{b(A^-)}=\frac{K_w}{K_{a(HA)}}
$$
$$
[OH^-]=\sqrt{K_{b(A^-)}[A^-]} \hspace{5mm}\text{as }\hspace{5mm} [A^-]=[OH^-]
$$
$$
pOH = -log \sqrt{K_{b(A^-)}[A^-]}
$$
$$
\mathbf{pH=14+log\sqrt{K_{b(A^-)}[A^-]}}
$$
	- **Beyond equivalence**, $OH-$ is in excess as all $HA$ is used up. (Self-ionization of $A^-$ is negligible compared to excess $OH^-$)
$$
[OH^-]=\frac{n_{OH}-n_{HA_0}}{V}
$$
$$
pOH=-log\frac{n_{OH}-n_{HA_0}}{V}
$$
$$
\mathbf{pH=14+log\frac{n_{OH}-n_{HA_0}}{V}}
$$

# R3.1.14-15 Indicator
- An indicator is a weak acid or base where the molecular form and its conjugate have different colour. ie. $HA\leftrightharpoons A^- +H^+$
- Adding $H^+$ or $OH^-$ shifts the equilibrium producing more molecular form or conjugate form.
$$HA\leftrightharpoons A^- +H^+$$
$$
K_a=\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}
$$
$$
pH=pK_a+log\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}
$$
- Colour depends on $\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$. Colour is a mix when $[A^-]=[HA]$ and changes when passing that concentration. Thus colour changes with $\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}=1$, or when $pH=pK_a$. This (region) is the [end point].
- Indicator should be selected to have their end point near the equivalence of the titration.
# R3.1.16-17 Buffers
- Buffers are weak acids/bases where both the molecule and its conjugate is present.
- However weak acids (or base) don't ionize much. We can:
	1. Add a strong base (or strong acid) to shift the reaction to the right.
		- First OH- react with H+ completely, H+ get produced, then strong base readct with H+ ...
		- However, when calculating we let OH- react with H+ completely, any excess, we react with HA to form A-.
		- Technically, afterwards we need to ICE table again to figure out new concentrations, but K_a is so week that nothing changes really.
		- We can then use Henderson-Hasselbalch equation directly. 
	2. Add a salt with conjugate base as an anion (or conjugate acid as a cation).
		- Le Chatelier's principle would shift the reaction to the right, but considering that K_b/K_a is tiny, the shift is also tiny.
	- Note that when considering this type of situations, one must consider the dilution of adding
