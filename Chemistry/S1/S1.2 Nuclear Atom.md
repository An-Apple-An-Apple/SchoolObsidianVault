> [!TIP] Wording
> 1. **Atom** means equal electron and proton. **Ion** means different proton and electron. **Isotopes** of the same element are atoms with same proton and different neutron, no specification of electron here.
> 2. **Relative atomic mass** is unique per element, it is the abundance-averaged mass. **Atomic mass number** is unique per isotope, it is the sum of proton and neutron per isotope. 
> 3. Relative **atomic** mass is the abundance-averaged mass of **atoms**. Relative **molecular** mass is the abundance-averaged mass of **molecules**.
> 4. Watch the word **nucleon** meaning both neutrons and protons.
