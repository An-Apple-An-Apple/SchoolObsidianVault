# R1
$O_2$ is double bonded.
$N_2$ is triple bonded.

# R2
R = 8.31 not 3.81
**==REMEMBER THE EXPONENT==** to the rate equation
# R3
watch the amount of OH produced per molecule, they all get released
**==REMEMBER THE EXPONENT==** in the ion dissociation constant 
Keep track of whether we are looking at OH-(pOH) or H+(pH), 
**==REMEMBER HOW MANY OH- and H- is RELEASED==** per molecule 
In a buffer, the conjugate and the H+/OH- is not the same concentration
==Keep track of OH- in base dilution and H+ in acid dilution, other way won't work==
==**Watch DILUTION when asking for the concentration of something (with known concentration) after its been added to something else**==
