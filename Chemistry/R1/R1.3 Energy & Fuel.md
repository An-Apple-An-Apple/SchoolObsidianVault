# R1.3.1 Combustion
- Most things can combust with oxygen and release energy
	- metal and non-metal -> something oxides
		- reactive metal combust while non reactive metal rust
	- hydrocarbon -> water + $CO_2$ or $CO$ or $C$ 
# R1.3.2 Incomplete Combustion
- incomplete combustion happens when there is a lack of oxygen, reaction happens, too fast, low oxygen concentration, or very large fuel particles
- products are $CO$ or $C$ instead of $CO_2$ thus release smoke
- flames are cooler and thus orange

> [!NOTE] Note
> - graphite doesn't produce water vapour cause theres no $H$

\* trace amounts of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and metals

- coal release the most CO_2 because only carbon and thus only one product CO_2 no water

**Advantages**
1. easy to transport
2. high energy density
3. relatively easy to produce
4. create industries
**Disadvantages**
5. pollution in production
6. pollution in combustion
7. makes worse the green house effect 
8. non-renewable -> production difficulty and cost will increase

- Green house effect is when greenhouse gas, especially carbon dioxide, absorbs IR and traps 
	- monooxide and carbon particles doesn't contribute
- Rapidly increase with human compustion of fossil fuel
- Green house gass $\propto$ temperature

- incomplete combustion lead to 
	- high fire hazard
	- more pollutants
	- less energy release per mole of fuel

# R1.3.4 Biofuel
- non-rewneable energy sources are those that can't be renewable as fast or faster than it is used
- photosynthesis: $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$
- **Advantages**
	- offset greenhouse gas production
	- inexpensive
	- cleaner combustion
- **Disadvantages**
	- still produce greenhouse gas
	- use land for agriculture

- ethnol produced by fermentation
- glycerol and methyl esters produced by transesterification

# R1.3.5 Fuel Cells
- electricity derived directly, no intermediate heat
- two spontaneous half reactions separated by membrane but connected by wire
- highly efficient 
- fuel is oxidized at the anode, flows to the cathode, reduces the oxygen. 
- methanol fuel cells (remember 6 of each, water in the annode, 3/2 oxygen gas) 
	- $CH_3OH + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + 6H^+ + 6e^-$
	- $\frac{3}{2}O_2 + 6H^+ + 6e^- \rightarrow 3H_2O$
- hydrogen fuel cells (2 hydrogen gas)
	- $2H_2 \rightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^-$
	- $O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2H_2O$
- hydrogen is hard to get
	- electrolysis needs a lot of energy
	- coal gasification release carbonmonoxide
- methanol fuel cells
	- still produce carbon dioxide
