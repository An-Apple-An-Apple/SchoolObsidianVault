# R1.4.1 Entropy
- entropy is measure of chaos
- when the moles of a chemical equation doesn't change, entropy change is small
- when the moles of gas in a chemical change is the same, entropy change is small
- increasing moles of gas increase entropy
- standard entropy is the entropy from 0K to standard condition
- change in entropy is just subtraction of standard entropy (final - initial)

# R1.4.2-3 Gibbs Energy and Spontaneity
- spontaneous reactions require only activation energy and will continue on its own
- entropy of the universe will always go up (sum of entropy of surrounding and system) natually
	- true of spontaneous reactions
- $\Delta{G}=\Delta{H}-T\Delta{S}$
- spontaneous if $\Delta{G}<0$ (free energy goes down)


> [!NOTE] NOTE
> Entropy is in J whereas enthalpy is in KJ

# R1.4.4 Gibbs Energy and Reversible Reactions
- Some reactions are reversible, they can go back and forth.
	- denoted by $\rightleftharpoons$ 
- Reactants will form products but when a certain ratio is met, it is at equilibrium and the reaction going forward is as fast, as likely, and as much as the reaction going backwards.
- K is $$\frac{\sum{[products]^{coeffs}}}{\sum{[reactants]^{coeffs}}}$$ when reaction is at equilibrium 
- Q is the same as K but at any point during the reaction not at equilibrium
- Gibbs energy can be plotted vs the reactions progress ![[Gibbs Energy Graph.png]]
- Reaction will tend to minimum. When $Q=K$, $\Delta{G}=0$, and reaction doesn't move anymore. but if Q is not at K, reaction will move Q towards K.
- K>1 means forward reaction is spontaneous or more products will be produced and proudcts are favored, and vice versa

> [!TIP] TIP
> Just use the 2nd and 3rd equation for gibbs's energy.
