# R1.1.1 Energy.
Energy. Energy is constant. 
System and Surrounding. 
Heat is transfer of thermal energy. Temperature is average thermal energy. 
Energy transfer happens in chemical reaction between system and surrounding. 
# R1.1.2-3 Endo- and Exo-thermic Reactions
- Endothermic reactions gains heat from the surrounding. 
- Exothermic release heat to the surrounding.
- Increase in heat -> increase in temperature
- Then there is the energy profile ![[Energy Profile.png]]
- Lower potential is more stable
# R1.2.4 Enthalpy and Heat Transfer
- Enthalpy is total energy content (not important)
- Change in enthalpy is measurable and tells us whether reaction is exothermic or endothermic and by how much
- Standard enthalpy of change is enthalpy change in constant pressure, condition and state
	- SATP 
- Thermal-chemical equation is equation plus standard enthalpy of change

- Calorimeter measure change in temperature.
- Use $Q=mc{\Delta}T$ to find heat.
- Use $\frac{Q}{n}$ to find enthalpy
- Note: always use $m$, $c$ and $\Delta{H}$ of the same substance. 
- Note: most likely we can only measure the $\Delta{H}$ of the surrounding. Place $-$ sign to find that equilivent for the system. 

- $1dm^3$ = $1000cm^3$ 
- $1L = 1000mL$
- $1dm^3$ of water is $1L$
- $1cm^3$ of water is $1ml$

- largest systemic error for calorimeter is heat loss
- makes abs value of enthalpy small
- we can ameliorate this by adding more insulation or using heating curve extrapolation
