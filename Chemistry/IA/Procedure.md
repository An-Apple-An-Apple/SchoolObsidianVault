# Reaction of Interest
**Reaction**
Calcium Carbonate and Hydrochloric Acid
$CaCo_{3(s)}+2HCL_{(aq)}\rightarrow CaCl_{2(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}+CO_{2(g)}$

$$
[CO_2]=\frac{ppm}{10^6}\frac{P_{gas}V_{gas}}{RT_{gas}}\frac{1}{V_{reaction}}
$$


**Uncertainty**
100mL graduate cylinder: ± 0.50 mL
Thermometer: ± 0.5 C
Mass Scale: ± 0.01g

**Qualitative Observation**
Bubbling violent once Calcium Carbonate reaches Hydrochloric Acid.
White solid residue after reaction reaches completion. 
Acadic odour.

**Systemic Error**
Conical flask is not sealed after short delay after calcium carbonates Hydrochloric Acid, thus the rate of reaction measured may not be exactly the initial. 
Conical flask is not dried then prepared with acid before new trial due to time constraint thus may decrease the concentration of the acid.
