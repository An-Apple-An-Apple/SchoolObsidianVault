[Vernier Labs] can help with procedure.

I first varied [HCL] concentration (2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 mol dm^-3) and recorded the initial rate of reaction (kPa s^-1) when 20 mL reacted with 2.5 g of powder CaCO_3. This is to find the order of reaction of HCl with CaCO_3, which was done through the rate equation (rate = k[HCl]^n) using a log-log plot (ln(rate) = nln[HCl]+lnk) by potting ln(rate)=m ln([HCl]) + b and taking the slope m (which is the order of reaction of HCl). Then I varied the temperature (2C, 10C, 21C, 30C) of 1.5 mol dm^-3 HCl. I recorded the initial rate of reaction of 20 mL of HCl at the varying temperature with 2.5 g of CaCO_3. Then I used the rate equation and order of reaction (n) to find the rate constant k (k = rate/[HCl]^n). I then use the Arrhenius equation (k^Ae^{-E_a/RT}) to find the E_a by plotting the log-log plot (link = (-E_a/RT) + ln A). \


My end goal is to find E_a.
