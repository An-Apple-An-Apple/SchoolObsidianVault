**How does Bradbury’s choice of tone and dialogue affect the reader’s perception of their relationships?**
Bradbury uses quick short bursts of dialogue to show a sober yet fatigued tone which highlights the suppression of emotions in a futuristic society. The author continues to build on this by introducing a melanchony tone using the lack of personal description of lover between Barling and Smith to their partners, underscoring the pensive retreat.

- narrative is informal -> personal connection

Bradbury uses the compliance of Barling and Smith to their partners to contrast a stereotypical patriarchy society to confront the audience of the asymmetrical gender roles and power dynamics of the 20th century. Smith feels pity for Braling's marriage and indicates the unwillingness of Braling, which continues solidify Bradbury's critique of the inequality of gender roles, by presenting a juxtaposition to stereotypes.

Bradbury uses the irony of *ethics*, introducing sleeping powder as un ethical by human replicate as ethical, to bring a critique to the audience of the fallible nature of humanity in front of emerging technology. A situational irony of the *ethicalness* of the Marionettes juxtaposes with the murder of Braling by a Marionettes and Braling's ridicule of grave consequences of uncontrolled advancement of technology.

Bradbury uses this juxtaposition as a critique the lack of transparentness of the growing technology sectors, and a ridicule of the capital incentive of pre-releasing technology prior to safety and legal assurance, which confronts the audience of similar activities in real life. 
- anacrhonism:

**How and to what effect does Bradbury employ foreshadowing?**
Marionettes are usually puppets controlled by strings. Bradbury uses foreshadow of "no string attached" for a description the escape of control of Marioneetes. Bradbruy uses this to foreshadow the eventual rebellion of Braling Two, and the tragic death of Braling, which highlights the potential consequences of lack of regulations on growing technologies and sciences.

**How does Bradbury’s use of suspense and gradual revelation of the marionette’s autonomy affect the reader’s own morals and ethics?**
Bradbury's initial description through Braling of the Marionettes as "ethical" and description of amount of freedom that they can bring contrasts with the eventual relevation of the possible crimes against humanity that these marionettes may commit. This suspesnse and gradual revelation of the marionette's autonomy invites the audience to question the fallibility of humans towards manipulation and biases and confront the audiences of whether their own perceived ethics are really correct.
