**How does Bradbury’s choice to personify the automated house influence the reader’s perception of technology and human absence?**
Bradbury personifies the automated house in the story *There will come soft rain*, having it "sing", "hiss", and "dart", to shape the audience's perception of technology, making it seem almost alive, however disturbingly hollow. The author uses this personification to contrast the seemingly alive technology with the complete absence of humanity which highlights the uncanny nature of the story. Bradbury describes the technology as a living caretaker, caring for the house in precision however without emotions and human awareness, which invites the reader to confront the idea that technology could outlive humanity without understanding humanity. The implication of this is a critique of blind technological advancements, which may replace, destroy, and outlive humanity without correct regulations. By giving the house human qualities, Bradbury emphases the tragedy of the destruction of humanity, which highlights the central theme: technological progress without ethical consideration could be self-sufficient leading to a future where machine survives, but humanity doesnt.
- humans are needed
- humans are existential angst (humans' lack of meaning outside of societal structure)
**In what ways does Bradbury’s use of vivid sensory imagery (sound, smell, movement) shape the tone and mood of the story?**
"In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunny side up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk." -> imagery of sound and movement creates a lively tone of a beautiful breakfast morning which, however, contrasts with the emptiness of the destruction of humanity to create a solemn and depressing mood. The machine's dedication of services creates a sense of euphoria and ultimate human freedom which hightens the tension of the juxtaposition of knowing there is not humans to serve. Bradbury uses this to tap into the motif of extential angst showing the business of the machines however with no real purpose. 
**How does the inclusion of Sara Teasdale’s poem within the narrative function as an authorial choice, and what are its implications for the story’s theme?**

-
