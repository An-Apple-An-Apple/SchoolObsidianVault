# Atmosphere and Mood: Pacing and Suspense
"He put the gun back into the bureau drawer and shut the drawer. No, not that way. Louse wouldn't suffer"
- This immediately sets a sinister tone and a mood of premediate malice. The protagonist's desire for Lousie to suffer "though imagination" introduces the audience to the horrific reality of his plan
" October didn't help any. If anything it made things worse"
- Bradbury uses setting of autumn to relfect the protagonist's emotional state. The sensory imagery of Halloween ("white bone masks," "cut pumpkins," "smell of candle was") creates a festive yet errie atmosphere, contrasting with the protagonist's grim intentions.
"He peered but saw nothing. THe entire program from here was on to be enacted in the dark."
- "program"
- "dark"
"The room was black black. Not a light, not a shine, not a glint of an eye"
- black black
"He handed over the knife. It passed from hand to hand, down and aounrd the circle"
- hand to hand
"Shot from hand to hand, with small screame after scream, the itmes went down, down, to be followed by another and another."
- repetition
"'Marion?', Marion did not asnwer. 'Marion are you there?' No answer. The room was silent. 'Marion!' No answer. It was quiet"
- suspense
