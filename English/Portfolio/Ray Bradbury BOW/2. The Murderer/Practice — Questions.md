**How does Bradbury’s use of a confined setting influence the mood and pacing of the story?**
Bradbury uses the confined setting to crate a solace mood in a silent and small room. This contrasts the convoluted and chaotic world, which confronts the audience of the distraction and temptations of the modern world. Bradbury uses this confined setting to slow the pace of the story as compared to the chaos and fast pace connection of the psychiatrist office. The lack of wrist watch, intercom, etc. within the confined setting allows for a singular and focused of debate as compared to the "beehive of offices" outside. Bradbury uses the limited space to allows the audience's attention to focus on the discussion with a slow pace conversation.
