# Chapter 1. The dark haired girl.
Winston received a message from the dark haired girl: "I love you".
Winston managed to approach her in the canteen exchanged information to meet at Victory Square.
Winston and the girl exchanged information to meet somewhere behind Paddington square.
Winston changes his perception of Julia, he wanted to kill her, now he loves her.
Winston wanted to die earlier, yet have a reason to live now.
He keeps worry about Julia changing her mind about him when he should be more worried about her being a thought police, or their interaction is found out.

> "A curious emotion stirred in Winston’s heart. In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone."
- morality of humanities

> "For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously."
- Surveillance

> "It was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed—in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that he was able to think continuously"
- surveillance

> "Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you."
- Surveillance

# Chapter 2. Julia Affairs
Winston dreamed of this occasion with Julia once.
Winston and Julia went to the meeting place, a hideout among the bushes. 
They tried but their stiffness drove them apart, they took a walk.
They appeared at the edge of the clearing and Winston remembered it was the Golden Country.
They saw a thrust — a bird — and Winston felt a tenderness. 
They went back to the clearing and did their thing.
They exchanged words about how much Julia have done this, and how much Winston love this rebellion. 
Winston wants everyone to corrupt. 
He keeps worry about Julia changing her mind about him when he should be more worried about her being a thought police, or their interaction is found out.
**Themes:** Rebellion, Corruption, Surviellence

> "There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized"
- Survillience

> "the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him."
- idk??? self-esteem?

> "But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women—he did not know the reason."
- Plato's cave, you crave the light of the outside world, yet that light blinds you when you step out of the cave, some may choose to embrace it and walk outside, others would turn around back into the cave

> "You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff. And you thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I’d denounce you as a thought-criminal and get you killed off?"
- idk

> "Actually I am that sort of girl, to look at. I’m good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I’ve spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always carry one end of a banner in the processions. I always Iook cheerful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that’s what I say. It’s the only way to be safe."
- inner corruption

> "An old, closebitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women’s hair."
- quite the contrast with the dystopian

> "It’s the Golden Country—almost,’ he murmured.
> 'The Golden Country?"
- foreshadowed before?

> "A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness?"
- a metaphor of his diary, who is he singing for?

> "His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been hundreds—thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity."
- desire for corruption, for the suppressed animalistic instincts, rebellion

> "Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. "
- desire for corruption, rebellion, constructivism

> "But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act."
- suppression and culture of fear

> "Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing."
- privacy

> "...the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen."
- surveillance and privacy 

> "He wished that they were a married couple of ten years’ standing. He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household."
- hope for a better world

> "There’s nothing those swine don’t have, nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things, and—look, I got a little packet of tea as well."
- inequality

> "I’ll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I’m going to be a woman, not a Party comrade."
- showcases the rebellion and desire for individuality and feminality

> "Of all horrors in the world—a rat!"
> "In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception..."
- idk what this rat thing is about, perhaps a symbolism. 

> "It’s a little chunk of history that they’ve forgotten to alter. It’s a message from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it."
- shows that even with the immense control of the Party, you still can't erase everything

> "There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia’s life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal."
- metaphor? the room is the coral. the glass paper weight

Repetition of 
> "day by day, minute by minute"

**Winston**: 
- believes in active rebellion, little ones here and there, building up to the whole
- believes that little piece of proof for the forgery of history should have been perserved
**Julia**:
- everyone could break the rules if they were safe to do so
- doesn't believe in mass rebellion nor the brotherhood
- she thinks maybe that the rocket bombs are lunched by the government itself to keep people scared
- doesn't care about anything that doesn't affect her directly
- she shows orthodoxy, but doesn't understand orthodoxy 
- honestly smart, intentionally doesn't think, makes life better, but also ... doesn't think

> "Syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed."
- erasure of people

> "Winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in going through back files of ‘The Times’ and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches."
- revisionism of history

> "As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual"
- diction of "harmonize" reveals the frenzy of the people, comparing it to the violence of a rocket bomb which undermines the humanity of the people while exaggerating the animalistic cruelty that such authoritarian dystopia evokes

> "Dirty or clean, the room was paradise."
- metaphor: relativism: little things becomes of great importance when the environment is horrendus

> "The room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. "
- metaphor: paradox: illusion of safety

> "There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor Cock Robin."
- idk symbolism?

> "There were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them."
- illusion of safety

> "It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In reality there was no escape."
- cynicism 

> "To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one’s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available."
- metaphor: bleak tone, hopelessness, cynicism

> "Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist."
> "Such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It would always exist, and it would always be the same. "
- rebellion -: cynism
- Julia character revelopment

> "The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania"
- skepticism, lack of trust, 

> "Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her."
- Julia: Character development

> History has stopped.
- history revisionism 

> "Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it."
> "They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird."
- false orthodoxy, control - not thought control: you can't control someones' mind

# Chapter 6. O'Brien
O'Brien approached Winston. 
O'Brien told Winston to get to him. Used showing him the 10th edition of the dictionary as an execuse.

> "The end was contained in the beginning."
- hope

# Chapter 7. Love
Repetition of "not certain of the date".
Repetition of "glass paper weight"
Lots of dreams, of "O'Brien" of the "Golden Conutry"

Winston was sleeping with Julia again.
He dreams and wakes up.
He recites to Julia his memories of his mother.
"There was never enough food."

Once chocolate ration: he stole the whole ration, then ran out. He came back: his mother and sister were gone.
He thinks that he murdered his mother.
Winston remembers the other dream about his mother and the sinking ship.
Winston reflects on love. How irrational and useless it is. Reflects that the party have voided them of it. Reflected that the proles are still human with love. -> allude to the song of the woman in Chapter 5.
Winston describes to Julia how they shouldn't continue. There's no hope for them when they get tortured. 
Winston describe that the only betrayal is not loving Julia.
Julia remarks that the only thing the party can't do is to spy on people's actual mind.

**Winston**:
 - Realizes love
 - Realizes that the party can't take away their inner thinking
**Julia**:
- remarks that she wouldn't have run from Winston even if its dangerous: "love"?
- Indicates that they can't change yoru inner thought -> does actually think

>  "It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. "
- love

> "The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world."
- lack of freedom: thought control

> "They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another."
> "The proles are human beings,’ he said aloud. ‘We are not human."
- proles, love

> "If I confess, they’ll shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they’ll shoot you just the same."
- powerless

> "The one thing that matters is that we shouldn’t betray one another, although even that can’t make the slightest difference."
> "I don’t mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn’t matter: only feelings matter."
- love?

> “They can’t do that,’ she said finally. ‘It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can make you say anything—ANYTHING—but they can’t make you believe it. They can’t get inside you.”
> “They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.”
- inner freedom and contorl
# Chapter 8. (The Brotherhood and O'Brien)

# Chapter 9. Oligarchical Collectivism.
There is a repetition. “This happened. This always happened” or “This didn't happen, this never happened”
Symbolism of "pyramids"
- pyramid ministries
- pyramid structure throughout the three state
- pyramid society

The hate week starts. 
There was a speech.
The speech changes midway from Eurasia as the enemy to Eastasia as the enemy. People did not question and accepted, all signs for the oppisition of Eurasia was deemd plots of Goldstein.
Winston received the book.
Winston worked overtime in the Ministry of Truth to change everything from Eurasia to Eastasis.
Winston went to Mr. Charington's shop to read the book.
Winston reads the first chapter.
Winston reads about the class division that always appear. 

**Chapter 2**
Winston reads the second chapter.
Winston reads about the history of the war.
Winston reads that war is not longer about material and have no clear purpose.
Developing and increasing manufacturing is essential because going back in technology and production makes a nation more susceptible to be destroyed.
However manufacturing and developing increase the quality of life and cognitive ability of the middle and lower class which makes the upper class loss absolute control of power. 
Thus war is a way to develop to give a nation power but to use up any surplus so the power is not destroyed within. To maintain external sovereignty and also inner sovereignty. 
Cognitive objectivity is reserved for the science of war. 
Doublethink deals with any of the independence thought. 
War is not longer for killing and such small conflict actually makes the wold more peaceful.
The inhabitants of any nations is never allowed to see another nation becuase they would realize that there is no difference.
The frontiers were always not crossed except by rocket bombs because the level of indoctrination makes full assimilation impossible. 
Only in the disputed lands could land be fought. 
War is continuous because it can not be won. Thus its not dangerous.
Its about having sovereignty.

Julia arrives, shows no interest in the book. Winston rereads from chapter 1.

**Chapter 1**
World is divided into classes.
The high's goal is to keep their position.
The middle's goal is to replace the high.
The lower's goal is to have equality.
From time to time in history, the middle enlist the low to help to help them defeat the high, then to replace the high.
A subgroup splits into to become the new middle.
The low goes back to where they are.
With intellectual and technological advances, the goal is to freeze this structure and have no longer the cyclic pattern — for the high to be the high forever, middle the middle and the low the low.
Because that history could be learned upon, and the means by which the high falls could be understood, they could be avoided, as so long as they are avoided properly, the structure could be forever.
This structure of oligarchy requires collectivism, for the power must be concentrated but is of no ones. (idk really?)
There are 4 reasons the high falls.
The world is not hierarchy, and thus socialism succeeds, while failing at the same time, because it fights class division, but when there is path of transfer between classes, there is no real division.

Then the book talks about three pillars of Ingsoc, three newspeak words.
CRIMESTOP
BLACKWHITE
DOUBLETHINK
The book reflects upon historical revisionism, and reality control.
Talks about the lack of comparison makes people content?

**Oligarchical Collectivism**
Oligarchical Collectivism - small group control put priority over the collective 
- individuality is suppressed
- sex is duty

**Class Division**
Marxist - Class division. 
- aggression between the middle and upper class
	- middle defeat upper and become upper
- lower class stay
High wants power to remain. Middle wants to replace the high. Low wants better life.
Middle use the low as an ally, however the party denies this.

**War is peace.** 
blah blah

**A cult of personality**
Big Brother -> absolute truth.

**No Private Emotion** (Ignorance is strenght)
All outer party is allowed to have emotion. Everything is controlled.

**Necessity of Doublethink**
Maintains the power of the upper class

**No Basis of Comparison**
Revision of history makes it impossible to compare.

**Lack of Values = Total Control**

**Finality for Winston**
He understood the how but did not know why.

> “On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one’s own side and not by the enemy, meritorious.”
- normalization of violence

> “The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror”
- slavery

> “the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war”
- realism?

> “Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented society.”
- thought control, knowledge control, education

> “But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away.”
- thought control, knowledge control, education

> “War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.”
- thought control, knowledge control, education

> “In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war.”
- Allude to suppression of love and sex makes hate a reasonable alternative. Such emotions can be alleviated through war. Using up all the power of the labour for war diminishes surplus.

> “The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought.”
- thought control

> “If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate.”
- control

> “Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare.”
- authoritarian universalism.

> “All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency.”
- reality control, 

> “Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the **past**, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.”
- metaphor: lack of comparison, historical revisionism

> “They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose.”
- reality control.

> “The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact.”
- idk control again? central really 

> “A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war.”
- central again?

---

> “The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.”
- idk central

> “Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. ”
> “There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life. ”
- inequality, central

> “The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century.”
- knowledge

> “In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization.”
- em central?

> “As compared with their opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition.”
- knowledge, thought control

> “With the development of television, and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end.”
- survillience

> “Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.”
- thought control

> “His function is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.”
- idk

> “The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living.”
- idk bro 

> “What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.”
- thought control

> “Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future.”
- speculation: thought control

> “But in any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE, and DOUBLETHINK, makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever.”
- idk

> “It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past can ever have existed.”
- revisionism of the past

> “... the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.”
- idk

> “For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one’s own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.”
- idk 

> “There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”
- idk

# Chapter 10. The Thought Police
Repetition of hate song.
Repetition of the women singing songs and pegging diapers.
Repetition of singing. 

Winston and Julia woke up. 
Winston discussed the woman below them in the metaphor of trees and fruits and songs. He said that she was beautiful.
Winston and Julia said "we are the dead".
Voice sounded from behind the picture — a telescreen.
Everything they said was repeated, highlights the subtly that the telescreen can pick up.
Man crashed into the room.
It was the thought police — it was Mr. Charington, weirdly enough, still praises the old pieces of the old world.

> “If there was hope, it lay in the proles!”
> “But you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.”
- hope

> 'We are the dead,’ he said.
> ‘We are the dead,’ echoed Julia dutifully.
> ‘You are the dead,’ said an iron voice behind them.
- hemm, death allusion, list, situational irony, tone shit, repetition, juxtaposing tone.   

> “The picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.”
- survillience and deception

> “... and that was the last he saw of her."
- idk

> “Pick up those pieces,’ he said sharply.”
- Why would the thought police care for the broken coral? To use it as the next bait? Or mayabe they are somewhat intelligent. Mr. Charington sure is intelligent.
