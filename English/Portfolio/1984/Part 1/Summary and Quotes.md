> And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence.

> ... the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth.

> Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact.
