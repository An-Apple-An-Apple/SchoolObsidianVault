# Chapter 1. Ministry of Truth.
Winston describes his time in the temporary holding cell.
Normal prisoners weren't treated that badly, only the political prisoners. 
A woman called Smith too was brought in. Winston thought she might be her mother because he has no way of knowing who her mother is.
Winston was moved to a new white clean room in the Ministry of Love. 
First was a poet. Then was Parsons. Then the roomed filled with a bunch of random prisoners and finally O'Brien came in.
Winston thought of Julia, he loved her but felt no love for her. (wtf?) He wished the pain could increase on him and to be lessened on Julia. A mental decision.
Winston was hit at the elbow. He realized that he would not wish for his pain to increase.

**Additional Theme:** Perception of time. Lights always on. No window. No way of knowing time. 

**Winston**
- doesn't love Julia
- thought more of O'Brien
**Ampleforth**
- talked about once before

> “The Party prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody.”
- idk

> “It was ‘all right’ in the camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes. ”
- normalization of concentration camps 
- forced labour is no worse then normal life

> “The positions of trust were given only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.”
- political prisoners were more terrified because they are going to the ministry of love.

> “More often he wondered where he was, and what time of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness.”
- deprivation of the senses

> “It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O’Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion.”
- foreshadowed and allusiont to O'Brien?

> “His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts.”
- thought control, lack of cognitive abilities 

> “I tried to do my best for the Party, didn’t I?”
- people are conscious of their orthodoxy 

> “Thank you,’ I’m going to say, ‘thank you for saving me before it was too late.”
- orthodoxy

> “Who denounced you?’ said Winston.
> ‘It was my little daughter,’ said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.”
- orthodoxy

> “Do anything to me!’ he yelled. ‘You’ve been starving me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is and I’ll tell you anything you want. I don’t care who it is or what you do to them. I’ve got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn’t six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes, and I’ll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!”
- culture of fear

> “He thought: ‘If I could save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.’ But that was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it.”
- paradox, doublethink

> “One question at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.”
- physical pain??? idk

O'Brien explains that the Party is trying to make people believe in the party not crush them. The party does not want fake obedience. 
O'Brien describes how the party is better than the past authoritarian. 
Winston at the end asks O'Brien questions.

> “The confession was a formality, though the torture was real.”
- torture

> “The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory.”
- culture of fear

> “... but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning.”
- thought control

> “He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him.”
- loss of individuality

> “It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend.”
- paradox: doublethink: thought controls

> “Even now, I am well aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue.”
- metaphor: reality control

> “But it was perfectly possible that O’Brien had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting.”
- thought control

> “In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?”
- historical revisionism

> “For a moment he clung to O’Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders.”
> “He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O’Brien.”
- stockholm syndrome
- metaphor of babies

> “The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.”
> “We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will.”
> “The command of the old despotisms was ‘Thou shalt not”. The command of the totalitarians was ‘Thou shalt”. Our command is ‘THOU ART”.”
- thought control

> “There was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O’Brien had not long ago known, examined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston’s mind. But in that case how could it be true that O’Brien was mad? It must be he, Winston, who was mad.”
