# Grammatical
The chilling escalation becomes apparent when the text states: "Withers, however, was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed" (Orwell). The capitalization of "UNPERSON" and the grammatical progression from present tense ("did not exist") to past perfect ("had never existed") illustrates how the euphemism doesn't describe reality—it creates a new reality.
