1. "This is only the beginning," said Mr. Brock. "I'm the
2. vanguard of the small public which is tired of noise 
3. and being taken advantage of and pushed around and 
4. yelled at, ==every== moment music, ==every== moment in touch 
5. with some voice somewhere, ==do== this, ==do== that, ==quick,== 
6. ==quick==, ==now== here, ==now== there. You'll see. The revolt 
7. begins. My name will go down in history!"

8. "Mmm." The psychiatrist seemed to be thinking.

9. "It'll take time, of course. It was all so ==enchanting== at 
10. first. The very idea of these things, the practical uses,
11. was wonderful. They were almost ==toys, to be played== 
12. ==with==, but the people got too involved, went too far, and 
13. got wrapped up in a pattern of social behavior and 
14. couldn't get out, couldn't admit they were in, even. So
15. they rationalized their nerves as something else. 'Our 
16. modern age,' they said. 'Conditions,' they said. 'High-
17. strung,' they said. But mark my words, the seed has 
18. been sown. I got world-wide coverage on ==TV, radio,==
19. ==films==; there's an irony for you. That was five days ago.
20. A billion people know about me. Check your financial
21. columns. Any day now. Maybe today. Watch for a 
22. sudden spurt, a rise in sales for French chocolate ice 
23. cream!"

The **diction ("enchanting")** brings about the connotation of goodness, and initial positive experience of technological advancement. Bradbury uses this diction to highlight that technology were development with only positivity in mind with a <u>lack of foresight</u> of the irritation and negative consequences that may come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | diction ("so enchanting") —  <u>lack of foresight</u>                                                                                                                                         |

This **epizeuxis ("quick, quick")** and **diacope ("do this, do that" and "now here, now there")** here portrays the ever relenting imperative of technology commanding people's action. Bradbruy uses this to highlight the technology control of humanity and in parallel, humanity's <u>loss of control</u> over technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | epizeuxis ("quick, quick"); diacope ("do this, do that" and "now here, now there") — <u>loss of control</u>                                                                                   |

This is **verbally ironic** because the the connotation of toys is something under control of humans, yet toy, here, represents something that in the future will dictate human actions, with humans depending on it and <u>losing control</u> over it.<br><br>This is also a metaphor comparing technology to toys. Bradbury uses this **satirical metaphor** to highlight that the technological advancement that would come to dictate human's action were initially thought to be just toys, made without consideration of its control of humanity in the future, highlighting the <u>lack of foresight</u> leading to a <u>loss of control</u> and <u>over-dependence</u>. | verbal irony ("toys, to be played with") — <u>losing control</u><br><br>satirical metaphor ("toys") — <u>lack of foresight</u> leading to a <u>loss of control</u> and <u>over-dependence</u> |

This is **situationally ironic** because he is spreading his condemnation of the <u>over-dependence</u> on technology, through technology itself. ~~Bradbury uses this irony to reinforce the inescapability of technology to do anything in a society where they dominate.~~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | situational irony ("TV, radio, films") — <u>over-dependence</u>                                                                                                                               |

| Another Part of the Murder   | Contrast-Diction, Parallelism, | In another part of the the Murder, Brock uses diathermy machine to disable the technology (radios, phones, etc.) that are specifically used for communication. Bradbury uses a **parallelism of "Wives cut off from husbands grousing about a hard day at work" and "Husbands cut off form their wives who have just seen their children break a window"** to bring the audience's attention to people's strong dependce on technology. Bradbury then immediately contrasts this "cutting of" with the diction of "Panic, sheer panic", which illustrates people inability to live without technology, highlighting that <u>over-dependence</u>,                                                                              | Parallelism "Wives cut off from husbands grousing about a hard day at work" and "Husbands cut off form their wives who have just seen their children break a window"; contrast-diction "Panic, sheer panic" OD |
| Another Part of the Murderer | Situational Irony              | Looking at the Murder as a whole, Bradbury repeatedly uses situational irony to highlight to inescapability of depending on technology once they dominate a society. For example, in two places we have talked about: Brock uses TV/film to promote his anti-technology movement, and uses a diathermy machine to disable other technologies, and in another of the part of the story, Brock uses a incinerator to destroy other household appliances. Bradbury repeatedly use this situational irony to highlight that <u>lack of foresight</u> of technological advancement creates society is so engraved by it that even to rid ourselves of it require the use of more technology, highlight the <u>over-dependence</u>. | situational irony, TV/film, diathermy machine, incinerator LF OD                                                                                                                                               |

1. [Alex] ==When I was there, I always felt like, fundamentally, it was a force for good. I don’t know if I feel that way anymore.==
2. [Joe] I left Google in June 2017, uh, due to ethical concerns. And… And not just at Google but within the industry at large.
3. [Justin] I’m very concerned. I’m very concerned.
4. [Tim] ==It’s easy today to lose sight of the fact that these tools actually have created some wonderful things in the world. They’ve reunited lost family members. They’ve found organ donors. I mean, there were meaningful, systemic changes happening around the world because of these platforms that were positive! I think we were naive about the flip side of that coin.==
![[Tim Apprehensive Side Gaze.png]]
5. [Alex] ==Yeah, these things, you release them, and they take on a life of their own. And how they’re used is pretty different than how you expected.==
![[Alex Daunting Side Gaze.png]]
6. [Jeff] Nobody, I deeply believe, ever intended any of these consequences.
7. [Lynn] There’s no one bad guy. No. Absolutely not.
8. [interviewer] So, then, what’s the… what’s the problem?
9. [interviewer] Is there a problem, and what is the problem?
10. [Jeff] [swallows]
11. [Justin] [clicks tongue] Yeah, it is hard to give a single, succinct… I’m trying to touch on many different problems.
12. [interviewer] What is the problem?

16. [birds singing]
17. [dog barking in distance]
18. [reporter 1] Despite facing mounting criticism, the so-called Big Tech names are getting bigger.
19. The entire tech industry is under a new level of scrutiny.
20. And a new study sheds light on the link between mental health and social media use.
21. [on TV] Here to talk about the latest research…
22. [Tucker Carlson] …is going on that gets no coverage at all.

Close up shots with strong sharp lighting is given to Alex as he begins narrating that you loss control of technology, here specifically referring to social media. Orlowski uses this close up and sharp lighting as visual emphasis to highlight the audience the importance of Alex's message, that once technology is released, they often work against the intended purpose, highlighting human's <u>lack of foresight</u> during technological advancements, and human's <u>loss of control</u> over technology once they are released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Close Up Shot + Sharp Lighting "Alex" LF LC  |
| 4:30 (33) | Shallow depth of field + Docudrama<br><br>Computer generated graphics | Furthermore, in another scene, a **docudrama** reenactment is shown where Isla is being called by here mom to set the table for breakfast, however she is so consumed by social media that she completely ignores her parents. The **shallow depth of field** shows the strong isolation Isla is from her environment, completely immersed and physically incapable of separating her self from it, highlight the <u>lost of control</u> of humans over technology, almost addicted to it. ~~The **docudrama** is also creates personal connection with the audience, confronting the audience to consider how the human's loss of control over technology plays in their daily lives.~~<br><br>The computer graphics also shows that Isla is scrolling through images of other people celebrating birthdays, being with friends and families, and images of human connection. This juxtaposes the fact that Isla could be experiencing similar real human connection too if she turns to the family breakfast, however she ignores her family and instead rely on technology to mimic such experience. These graphics highlights the growing <u>over-dependence</u> of humans on technological advancements to imitate authentic human human connections | Docudrama + Shallow Depth of Field "Isla" LC |
| 4:07      | Archival Footage + News Overlay + Ominous Bass Music                  | Here, Orlowski combines the news reporting on fake news with the select hearing of Jack Dorsey on the foreign influence through social media during presidential elections. Jack Dorsey at a select hearing vows that "[they] weren’t expecting any of this when we created Twitter over 12 years ago," referring the usage of social media to influence presidential elections. Orlowski uses this combination of related archival footage from news and select hearing to highlight human's, this case, Twitter's, <u>loss of control</u> over what technology can do. And secondly, Dorsey's statement further exemplified that there was a <u>lack of foresight</u> initially that allowed it to influence humanity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                              |
