| The murderer                 | Psychiatrist and Brock. Lack of privacy due to strong connections brought by technology. Technology's overwhelming distraction. Family dymanics: man. Over reliance on technology. Technology controlling humans. Lack of foresight.                                                 | "This is only the beginning," said Mr. Brock. "I'm the vanguard (9) of the small public which is tired of noise and being taken advantage of and pushed around and yelled at, every moment music, every moment in touch with some voice somewhere, do this, do that, quick, quick, now here, now there. You'll see. The revolt begins. My name will go down in history!" "Mmm." The psychiatrist seemed to be thinking. "It'll take time, of course. **It was all so enchanting at first. The very idea of these things, the practical uses, was wonderful.** They were almost toys, to be played with, **but the people got too involved, went too far, and got wrapped up in a pattern of social behavior and couldn't get out**, couldn't admit they were in, even. So they rationalized their nerves as something else. 'Our modern age,' they said. 'Conditions,' they said. 'High- strung,' they said. But mark my words, the seed has been sown. I got world-wide coverage on TV, radio, films; there's an irony for you. That was five days ago. A billion people know about me. Check your financial columns. Any day now. Maybe today.

What alchemy had there been in Louise that took the dark of a dark man and bleached the dark brown eyes and black hair and washed and bleached the ingrown baby all during the period before birth until the child was born, Marion, blonde, blue-eyed, ruddy-cheeked? Sometimes he suspected that Louise had conceived the child as an idea, completely asexual, an immaculate conception of contemptuous mind and cell. As a firm rebuke to him she had produced a child in her own image, and, to top it, she had somehow fixed the doctor so he shook his head and said, „Sorry, Mr Wilder, your wife will never have another child. This is the last one.“ „And I wanted a boy,“ Mich had said eight years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |             |

The tombs, ill-lit by television light, where the people sat like the dead, the gray or multi-colored lights touching their faces, but never really touching them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Technology? |

For want of ten mice, a fox dies. For want of ten foxes a lion starves. For want of a lion, all manner of insects, vultures, infinite billions of life forms are thrown into chaos and destruction. Eventually it all boils down to this: fifty nine million years later, a caveman, one of a dozen on the entire world, goes hunting wild boar or saber toothed tiger for food. But you, friend, have stepped on all the tigers in that region. By stepping on one single mouse. So the caveman starves. And the caveman, please note, is not just any expendable man, no! He is an entire future nation. From his loins would have sprung ten sons. From their loins one hundred sons, and thus onward to a civilization. Destroy this one man, and you destroy a race, a people, an entire history of life. It is comparable to slaying some of Adam's grandchildren. The stomp of your foot, on one mouse, could start an earthquake, the effects of which could shake our earth and destinies down through Time, to their very foundations. With the death of that one caveman, a billion others yet unborn are throttled in the womb. Perhaps Rome never rises on its seven hills. Perhaps Europe is forever a dark forest, and only Asia waxes healthy and teeming. Step on a mouse and you crush the Pyramids. Step on a mouse and you leave your print, like a Grand Canyon, across Eternity. Queen Elizabeth might never be born, Washington might not cross the Delaware, there might never be a United States at all. So be careful. Stay on the Path. Never step off! | Technology  |

[sips] Before that, um, I was the… the director of monetization at Facebook for five years.<br><br>[Jeff Seibert] While at Twitter, I spent a number of years running their developer platform, and then I became head of consumer product.<br><br>[Justin Rosenstein] I was the coinventor of Google Drive, Gmail Chat, Facebook Pages, and the Facebook like button.<br><br>[Joe] Yeah. This is… This is why I spent, like, eight months talking back and forth with lawyers. This freaks me out.<br><br>[Alex] When I was there, I always felt like, fundamentally, it was a force for good. I don’t know if I feel that way anymore.<br><br>[Joe] I left Google in June 2017, uh, due to ethical concerns. And… And not just at Google but within the industry at large.<br><br>[Justin] I’m very concerned. I’m very concerned.<br><br>[Tim] It’s easy today to lose sight of the fact that these tools actually have created some wonderful things in the world. They’ve reunited lost family members. They’ve found organ donors. I mean, there were meaningful, systemic changes happening around the world because of these platforms that were positive! I think we were naive about the flip side of that coin.<br><br>[Alex] Yeah, these things, you release them, and they take on a life of their own. And how they’re used is pretty different than how you expected.<br><br>[Jeff] Nobody, I deeply believe, ever intended any of these consequences.<br><br>[Lynn] There’s no one bad guy. No. Absolutely not.<br><br>[interviewer] So, then, what’s the… what’s the problem?<br><br>[interviewer] Is there a problem, and what is the problem?<br><br>[Jeff] [swallows]<br><br>[Justin] [clicks tongue] Yeah, it is hard to give a single, succinct… I’m trying to touch on many different problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                | “Whether it is to be utopia or oblivion will be a touch-and-go relay race right up to the final moment…”  <br>—Buckminster Fuller<br><br>[Tristan] A lot of what we’re saying sounds like it’s just this… one-sided doom and gloom. Like, “Oh, my God, technology’s just ruining the world and it’s ruining kids,” and it’s like… “No.” [chuckles] It’s confusing because it’s simultaneous utopia… and dystopia. Like, I could hit a button on my phone, and a car shows up in 30 seconds, and I can go exactly where I need to go. That is magic. That’s amazing.<br><br>[Justin] **When we were making the like button, our entire motivation was, “Can we spread positivity and love in the world?” The idea that, fast-forward to today, and teens would be getting depressed when they don’t have enough likes, or it could be leading to political polarization was nowhere on our radar.**<br><br>[Joe] I don’t think these guys set out to be evil. It’s just the business model that has a problem.<br><br>[Alex Roetter] You could shut down the service and destroy whatever it is– $20 billion of shareholder value– and get sued and… But you can’t, in practice, put the genie back in the bottle. You can make some tweaks, but at the end of the day, you’ve gotta grow revenue and usage, quarter over quarter. **It’s… The bigger it gets, the harder it is for anyone to change.**<br><br>[Tristan] What I see is a bunch of people who are trapped by a business model, an economic incentive, and shareholder pressure that makes it almost impossible to do something else.<br><br>[Sandy] I think we need to accept that it’s okay for companies to be focused on making money. What’s not okay is when there’s no regulation, no rules, and no competition, and the companies are acting as sort of de facto governments. And then they’re saying, “Well, we can regulate ourselves.” I mean, that’s just a lie. That’s just ridiculous.<br><br>[Jaron] Financial incentives kind of run the world, so any solution to this problem has to realign the financial incentives.<br><br>[Joe] **There’s no fiscal reason for these companies to change. And that is why I think we need regulation.** |
