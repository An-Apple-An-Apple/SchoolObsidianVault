### Part 1: The Student Presentation (Introduction)

**Student:** "So, chaos theory describes even the flutter of a butterfly's wings as something that can cause a typhoon halfway across the world. If such a minuscule action can have such extreme consequences, just thinking of how every human, every day, must be impacting the environment and the future of humanity to such an extent is truly nerve-racking in a sense. So I’d like to explore this further within the field of inquiry of science, technology, and the environment. More specifically, I'd like to focus on the global issue of how humanity's lack of foresight and ill-considered actions today can jeopardize the future of both the natural world and humans themselves.

In order to do this, I'll be looking at a literary body of work which includes a short story, _A Sound of Thunder_ by author Ray Bradbury from the 1953 collection _The Golden Apples of the Sun_, which describes the time travel journey of Eckels and how he realizes just how much his actions can impact the future of humanity. I will also be examining the non-literary text, which is a climate change speech by Greta Thunberg for a 2018 TEDx event, in which she details how our inaction today can result in irreversible impacts for the future of humanity."

### Part 3: The Student Presentation (Literary Analysis)

**Student:** "So first off, looking at my literary extract. In line one, we see Bradbury use aporia as Eckels ignorantly questions, 'So they're dead. So what?' referring to the death of a mouse. And his guide, Travis, uses typtophora [sic] on line two as he incredulously repeats this question and then answers it in the remainder of the extract. So Eckels symbolizes all of humanity's worst characteristics. He's selfish, he's greedy, he has no concern for anything but himself. But in this extract, Travis acts as a moral voice, one of caution in teaching Eckels just how much his actions can contribute to detrimental impacts on the environment and for the future of humanity.

Bradbury further uses anaphora and parallelism with the phrase 'for want of' to explain the delicate balance of nature and how one small action today can result in the death of infinite billions of life forms. He also uses synecdoche on line 11, equating the death of a man to the death of a race, a people, an entire history of life. Further exemplifying how this one small action has just not just immense consequences for nature, but also for the future of humanity itself. He also uses exaggeration to illustrate the exponential nature of time, exacerbating imbalances in the natural world.

Furthermore, we can see that Bradbury uses allusions and analogies through lines 15 and 19. For example, he suggests how this one small action of stepping on a mouse today can cause Rome to cease to exist. Rome today is revered as one of the greatest civilizations to exist. So just one small action that completely eliminates it from human history is truly scary to think about. He also refers to stepping on a mouse as equivalent to crushing the pyramids, which are a symbol of great pride and human ingenuity. So this one small action can completely wipe those momentous occasions from human history.

Finally, Bradbury concludes this extract with a warning on line 19 saying, 'So be careful.' Now that the audience understands just how much impact their every action can have on the future of the natural world and humanity, he urges them to employ foresight and carefully consider their every action and the consequences before doing anything.

We can see similar themes within the larger body of work. For example, when Eckels and his team return from this time travel expedition, they realize that Eckels has killed a small butterfly despite being warned on numerous occasions not to interact with his environment. Bradbury uses polysyndeton to describe the butterfly as a small thing that could upset balances and knock down a line of small dominoes and then big dominoes and then gigantic dominoes, all down the years across time. Exemplifying how, as time goes on, it can exacerbate these impacts on the environment. He also uses the motif of a butterfly to symbolize the fragility of our existence—how one small instance can cause all of us to simply cease to exist or be transported to an entirely different world.

For example, when Eckels and his team return to the future, they realize that the atmospheric conditions have changed. They realize that the spelling of the English language has shifted tremendously and even the President of the United States has been changed. We can also see similar themes of a lack of foresight and the implications of this in other Bradbury short stories such as _There Will Come Soft Rains_, which is set after a 2026 nuclear fallout. And in this story, the technology in a house continues to function such as the dishwasher and the watch, while the humans cease to exist. This story exemplifies a lack of foresight in that humans have developed nuclear weapons but evidently were unable to make the correct decisions in using them as they've perished as a result of these weapons that they themselves developed.

In addition, in Bradbury's short story _Marionettes, Inc._, we see the protagonist Braling use an android robot to replace his duty as a husband as he shuns this responsibility. However, he ignores the potential consequences of this action and ultimately, his android robot ends up replacing him in his marriage, which is a direct product of Braling's lack of foresight in understanding how this action could turn on him, how this action could lead to him suffering immense consequences. So we can see how humanity's lack of foresight and how them not considering their actions can jeopardize their future but also the future of the natural world."
